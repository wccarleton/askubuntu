Forest establishment and retreat was roughly synchronous across most of northern Russia, Treeline advance on the Kola Peninsula, however, appears to have occurred later than in other regions. During the period of maximum forest extension, the mean July temperatures along the northern coastline of Russia may have been 2.5 degrees to 7.0 degrees C warmer than modern. The development of forest and expansion of treeline likely reflects a number of complimentary environmental conditions, including heightened summer insolation, the demise of Eurasian ice sheets, reduced sea-ice cover, greater continentality with eustatically lower sea level, and extreme Arctic penetration of warm North Atlantic waters. The late Holocene retreat of Eurasian treeline coincides with declining summer insolation, cooling arctic waters, and neoglaciation, (C) 2000 University of Washington.

The high sensitivity results from effects of hemispheric or global-scale changes in circulation patterns of the ocean and atmosphere to influence the pathway's and locations of air masses and storm tracks. Holocene paleoflood chronologies from the Upper Mississippi Valley in the Midwest United States and from the Colorado River drainage of the Southwest United States show that recurrence frequencies of large floods have been subject to abrupt changes over time. These flood chronologies and hood chronologies observed for other middle-latitude regions suggest that recurrence frequencies of large hoods are increased when there is an increase in the number of waves and their amplitudes in the middle and upper tropospheric circum-polar westerly circulation. However, some middle-latitude regions on the western margins of continents experience increased frequencies of flooding during strong onshore zonal westerly circulation. Flood chronologies from several regions suggest that times of rapid climate change have a tendency to be associated with more frequent occurrences of large and extreme floods. The unusual high frequencies of large floods that have been observed in many regions since the early 1950s are often attributed to land use change, but the rapid climate forcing from the effects of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases may also be a contributing factor. Paleoflood records provide information that is useful for better interpretation and calibration of modern short-term instrumental records, and they provide unique event-scale information that is useful fbr calibrating and testing geophysical models of past and anticipated future climate conditions.

Variations of its level are indicative of the climate variations in the region. Here, we present the decadal- to centennial-resolution Holocene lake-level curve of the Dead Sea. Then we determine the regional hydroclimatology that affected level variations. To achieve this goal we compare modem natural lake-level variations and instrumental rainfall records and quantify the hydrology relative to lake-level rise, fall, or stability. To quantify that relationship under natural conditions, rainfall data pre-dating the artificial Dead Sea level drop since the 1960s are used. In this respect, Jerusalem station offers the longest uninterrupted pre- 1960s rainfall record and Jerusalem rains serve as an adequate proxy for the Dead Sea headwaters rainfall. Principal component analysis indicates that temporal variations of annual precipitation in all stations in Israel north of the current 200 mm yr(-1) Average isohyet during 1940-1990 are largely synchronous and in phase (similar to70% of the total variance explained by PC1). This station also represents well northern Jordan and the area all the way to Beirut, Lebanon, especially during extreme drought and wet spells. We (a) determine the modem, and propose the past regional hydrology and Eastern Mediterranean (EM) climatology that affected the severity and length of droughts/wet spells associated with multiyear episodes of Dead Sea level falls/rises and (b) determine that EM cyclone tracks were different in average number and latitude in wet and dry years in Jerusalem. The mean composite sea level pressure and 500-mb height anomalies indicate that the potential causes for wet and dry episodes span the entire EM and are rooted in the larger-scale northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation. We also identified remarkably close association (within radiocarbon resolution) between climatic changes in the Levant, reflected by level changes, and culture shifts in this region.

These are characterized by simultaneous accumulation and ablation in summer season. The southeast part of the Tibetan Plateau experiences monsoonal precipitation in excess of 1000 mm/yr resulting in maritime temperate glaciers. In contrast, precipitation in the middle and northwest part of the Tibet Plateau decreases from 1000 to 200 mm/yr, resulting in the formation of continental cold glaciers. During the last glacial, the regions of heavy monsoonal precipitation were restricted to the southeast corner of the Plateau. The westerly weak precipitation zone shifted southward, and occupied the major northwest part of the Plateau, where the extreme continental type glaciers greatly expanded. In the eastern margin of Asia including Taiwan, Central Japan, Hokkaido and probably Mount Changbai, maritime type glaciers were more extensive because of higher monsoonal precipitation, especially heavy snowfall in northwest Japan owing to the rich moisture content of the winter monsoon over the Japan Sea. The millennial scale monsoon intensity and glacial cycle in the Tibetan Plateau are strongly affected by the precession cycle and the orbit-inclination cycle which dominate the solar irradiance variation in low latitudes, as the high radiation and strong monsoon caused the warmer and wetter climate during 40-30ka. The low radiation produced a weak monsoon and large depression of temperature and precipitation around 21 ka. This climatic pattern differs from that in the high latitudes where the eccentricity cycle is prominent. The temperature during the last glacial maximum (LGM) was 6-9degreesC lower than today on the Tibetan Plateau and the equilibrium line altitude was depressed by about 1000m in the southeast part, and in the east, south and west margins of the Plateau where precipitation was high. The equilibrium line depression was 500-300 m in the inner and especially the west part of the Plateau. This variation in equilibrium lines might be caused by the combined effect of the decrease in precipitation, the expansion of extreme continental glaciers and the active uplift of glaciated mountains. The estimation of a glaciated area of about 350,000 km(2) in the Tibetan Plateau and roughly 500,000 km(2) in High Asia based on observations of prominent features of LGM glacier extension, may be the direct evidence that shows there was no Quaternary unified ice sheet developed in the Tibetan Plateau.

Climate conditions, as revealed by the pollen records of this sapropel in marine cores, were most favorable for temperate deciduous trees, which is in agreement with the inferences from records of peripheral land pollen sites. The abundance of deciduous oak pollen is much higher than that of Artemisia (sage-brush), indicating that annual precipitation in the mid-elevation borderlands was at least 550 mm without summer drought, but more probably in the range 800-1300 mm. The pollen of Pistacia, which formed a savanna at low elevations, is also at its highest abundance and signals the absence of frost in winter, while being capable of withstanding summer drought. The early Holocene therefore appears as the post-glacial climatic optimum with the highest moisture and mildest winters. In southwest Asia, this is also the time of the Neolithic population explosion with incipient domestication of cereals, possibly following natural selection of the 'tough rachis' mutation in wheat and barley by the extreme aridity of the preceding Younger Dryas.

Hominin variability, climatic instability and population demography in Middle Pleistocene Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; HUESOS DENTAL SAMPLES; HOMO-ERECTUS; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; GRAN DOLINA-TD6; TIME-SCALE; ATAPUERCA; SIMA; RECORD; COLONIZATION	We propose a population model for Middle Pleistocene Europe that is based on demographic "sources" and "sinks". The former were a small number of "core" or populations in glacial refugia in southern Europe from which hominins expanded northwards in interstadial and interglacial periods; occupation outside glacial refugia would have been restricted to warm or temperate periods, and populations at the northern limit of the Middle Pleistocene range would have been "sink" populations in that they depended upon recruitment from source populations further south. Southwest Asia would also have been a likely source of immigrant, source populations. We argue as an alternative to an "ebb and flow" model in which groups retreated to refugia when conditions worsened that local extinction outside refugia would have been frequent. In extreme situations, Europe may have been a population "sink" (i.e. unpopulated) that was replenished from source populations in Southwest Asia. We suggest that this pattern of repeated colonisation and extinction may help explain the morphological variability of European Middle Pleistocene hominins, particularly Homo heidelbergensis and its apparent non-lineal evolution towards Homo neanderthalensis.

However, the role of climate forcing in this process has remained unclear. Here we present a last glacial record that provides insight into climate-related environmental shifts in the eastern Mediterranean region, i.e. the gateway for the colonisation of Europe by AMH. We show that the environmental impact of the Heinrich Event H5 climatic deterioration c. 48 kyr ago was as extreme as that of the glacial maximum of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4 when most of Europe was deserted by Neanderthals. We argue that Heinrich H5 resulted in a similar demographic vacuum so that invasive AMH populations had the opportunity to spread into Europe and occupy large parts before the Neanderthals were able to reoccupy this territory. This spread followed the resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at the beginning of Greenland Interstadial (GIS) 12 c. 47 kyr ago that triggered an extreme and rapid shift from desert-steppe to open woodland biomes in the gateway to Europe. We conclude that the extreme environmental impact of Heinrich H5 within a situation of competitive exclusion between two closely related hominids species shifted the balance in favour of modern humans.

The palaeoflood record, with more than 80 flood events, shows clusters of floods at specific periods from 9440 to 9210 (14)C yr BP (8540-8110 BC, 8500 to 8000 (14)C yr BP (7500-7000 BC). similar to 6750 (14)C yr BP (similar to 5000 BC), 1200 to 950 (14)C yr BP (AD 785-1205), similar to410 (14)C yr BP (AD 1450-1500) 170 to 80 14C yr BP (AD 1670-1950). The largest flood(s) occurred during the periods 9440 to 9210 (14)C yr BP, similar to 6750 (14)C yr BP and 1200 to 950 (14)C yr BP reaching minimum discharge estimates of between 4000 and 4100 m(3) s(-1) in the El Puente del Arzobispo reach and 13,700-15, 000 m(3) s(-1) in the Alcantara reach. These periods with increased flood magnitude and/or frequency in the Tagus River are strongly related to increased moisture influx and winter precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the western zone. Proxy records sensitive to winter precipitation such as lake levels and vegetation changes (indicated by pollen records) are in good agreement with the clusters of floods found in the Tagus River. This flood variability seems to correspond to changes in the prevailing atmospheric circulation pattern affecting the Iberian Peninsula. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Growth layers, which are measurable over the last 250 years, are shown to be annual. The correlation between the width of growth layers and precipitation is strongly positive. Changes in delta(18)O and delta(13)C are positively correlated and inversely correlated to changes in the colour of the growth layers in the stalagmite. Variations in colour are directly correlated with mean annual temperature. Dark colouration is the product of increased temperature and mobilization of organic matter from the soil, and is associated with wetter summers and enhanced growth of C-4 grasses. Darker colouring and enriched delta(18)O and delta(13)C reflect a warmer, wetter environment, whereas lighter colouring and depleted isotopic values are indicative of cooler, drier conditions. The dominant episode in the 3000-year record is the cool, dry 500-year manifestation of the 'Little Ice Age', from AD 1300 to about 1800, with the lowest temperatures at around AD 1700. The four centuries from AD 900 to 1300, experiencing above-average warming and high variability, may be the regional expression of the medieval warming. Other cool, dry spells prevailed from around AD 800 to 900 and from about AD 440 to 520. The most prolonged warm, wet period occurred from AD 40 to 400. Some extreme events are shown to correspond well with similar events determined from the Greenland GISP2 ice-core record and elsewhere. Distinct periodicities occur within the record at around 120, 200-300, 500-600 and at about 800 years BP.

Oxygen isotope variation in these speleothems primarily represents changes in the meteoric waters falling above the caves, possibly responding to latitudinal changes in the position of the Subtropical Front in the Tasman Sea. Seven positive excursions can be identified in the oxygen isotope record, which coincide with periods of glacier advance, known to be sensitive to northward movement of the Subtropical Front. Four glacier advances occurred during oxygen isotope stage 2, with the most extreme glacial conditions centered on 19,000 cal yr B.P.(2) An excursion in the oxygen isotope record from 13,800 to 11,700 cal yr B.P. provides support for a previously identified New Zealand glacier advance at the time of the Younger Dryas Stade, but suggests it began slightly before the Younger Dryas as recorded in Greenland ice cores. Carbon isotope variations in the speleothems record changes in forest productivity, closely matching existing paleovegetation records. On the basis of vegetation changes, stage 2 glacial climate conditions terminated abruptly in central New Zealand, from 15,700 to 14,200 cal yr B.P. Evidence of continuous speleothem grovvth at one site suggests that depression of the local treeline was limited to 600-700 m below its present altitude, throughout the last 31,000 years.

During both penultimate and last glaciations, a steppe of Artemisia and Poaceae dominated the upland vegetation with a high proportion of Chenopodiaceae in both upland and lowland saline ecosystems. While Juniperus and deciduous Quercus trees were extremely rare and restricted to some refugia, Hippophae rhamnoides constituted an important phanerophyte, particularly during the late last glacial period. A pronounced expansion in Ephedra shrub-steppe occurred at the end of the penultimate late-glacial period but was followed by extreme aridity that favoured an Artemisia steppe. Very high lake levels, registered by both pollen and sedimentary markers, occurred during the middle of the last glaciation and late part of the penultimate glaciation. The late-glacial to early Holocene transition is represented by a succession of Hippophae, Ephedra, Betula, Pistacia and finally Juniperus and Quercus. The last interglacial period (Eemian), slightly warmer and moister than the Holocene, was followed by two interstadial phases similar in pattern to those recorded in the marine isotope record and southern European pollen sequences.

This question cannot be fully answered in our present state of knowledge, but at least we can try to illustrate, with three case studies from different continents, time periods and ecosystems, some fundamental changes in the relationship between natural processes and human activities that occur, as we pass from a nature-dominated to a human dominated environment. 1. Early-mid Holocene: Nature dominated environment - human adaptation, mitigation, and migration. In the central Andes, the Holocene climate changed from humid (10,800-8000 BP) to extreme arid (8000-3600 BP) conditions. Over the same period, prehistoric hunting communities adopted a more sedentary pattern of resource use by settling close to the few perennial water bodies, where they began the process of domesticating camelids around 5000 BP and irrigation from about 3100 BP. 2. Historical period: An agrarian society in transition from an "enduring" to an innovative human response. Detailed documentary evidence from Western Europe may be used to reconstruct quite precisely the impacts of climatic variations on agrarian societies. The period considered spans a major transition from an apparently passive response to the vagaries of the environment during the 16th century to an active and innovative attitude from the onset of the agrarian revolution in the late 18th century through to the present day. The associated changes in technology and in agricultural practices helped to create a society better able to survive the impact of climatic extremes. 3. The present day: A human dominated environment with increasing vulnerability of societies and economies to extreme events and natural variability. The third example, dealing with the history and impact of floods in Bangladesh, shows the increasing vulnerability of an over-exploited and human-dominated ecosystem. Measurements exist for a short time only (decades), historical data allow a prolongation of the record into the last century, and paleo-research provides the long-term record of processes operating over millennia. The long-term paleo-perspective is essential for a better understanding of future potential impacts on an increasingly human-dominated environment. Understanding today's global change processes calls for several new perspectives and synergisms: the integration of biophysically oriented climate change research with research about the increasingly dominant processes of human forcing, a focus on overexploited or limited natural resources and on vulnerable and critical regions, fuller use of our understanding of variability on a range of different timescales:"The present without a past has no future".

QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article							GREENLAND ICE CORE; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; C-14 DATA; VARIABILITY; CALIBRATION; TEMPERATURE; VOLCANISM; ACCUMULATION; IRRADIANCE	Changes in solar constant over an 11 yr cycle suggest a certain, but limited, degree of solar forcing of climate. The high-resolution climate (oxygen isotope) record of the Greenland GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) ice core has been analyzed for solar (and volcanic) influences. The atmospheric C-14 record is used as a proxy of solar change and compared to the oxygen isotope profile in the GISP2 ice core. An annual oxygen isotope profile is derived from centimeter-scale isotope measurements available for the post-A.D. 818 interval. Associated extreme summer and winter isotope ratios were found to yield similar climate information over the last millennium. The detailed record of volcanic aerosols, converted to optical depth and volcanic explosivity change, was also compared to the isotope record and the oxygen isotope response calibrated to short-term volcanic influences on climate. This calibration shows that century-scale volcanic modulation of the GISPZ oxygen isotope record can be neglected in our analysis of solar forcing. The timing, estimated order of temperature change, and phase lag of several maxima in C-14 and minima in O-18 are suggestive of a solar component to the forcing of Greenland climate over the current millennium. The fractional climate response of the cold interval associated with the Maunder sunspot minimum (and C-14 maximum), as well as the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age temperature trend of the past millennium, are compatible with solar climate forcing, with an order of magnitude of solar constant change of similar to 0.3%. Even though solar forcing of climate for the current millennium is a reasonable hypothesis, for the rest of the Holocene the century-scale events are more frequent in the oxygen isotope record than in the C-14 record and a significant correlation is absent. For this interval, oceanic/atmospheric circulation forcing of climate may dominate. Solar forcing during the surprisingly strong 1470 yr climate cycle of the 11,000-75,000 yr B.P. interval is rather hypothetical. (C) 1997 University of Washington.

Taken together with similarly high-resolution terrestrial sequences, these records indicate a regional climatic progression, beginning with the extreme and variable climate late in the penultimate glaciation, continuing through a relatively stable climatic optimum during the interglaciation, and concluding with the reestablishment of the markedly variable regime that characterized the last 100,000-yr glaciation. Relatively mild conditions in much of the subpolar region significantly outlasted the minimum in global ice volume, despite declining summer insolation and the cooling influence of incipient proximal glaciers. These effects were partially offset by enhanced thermohaline circulation that paradoxically increased heat transport into the region while simultaneously providing the likely moisture source for the growth of large northern ice sheets. The inception of the last glacial cycle thus provides an example of the influence of ocean circulation on regional climate. In contrast to the apparent orbital pace of the ongoing ice-sheet growth, the subsequent deterioration of surface conditions was abrupt and dramatic. (C) 2002 University of Washington.

The 19th century part of the Little Ice Age represents a thermal minimum, whilst the warmest decades of the 20th century are close to the estimated Holocene thermal maximum. A model describing sea ice-climate-ELA relationships in Northern Iceland for this period has been developed, providing a calibrated proxy climate record as a basis for palaeoclimatic reconstruction for the Holocene as a whole. Glacier advances in the periods around 4700 BP, around 4200 BP, ca. 3200-3000 BP, around 2000 BP, around 1500 BP and around 1000 BP, based on radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology, mark climatic minima of the post-Preboreal Holocene, when conditions were comparable to the extremes in the second half of the 19th century. Compared to optimal Holocene thermal conditions, with temperatures at least as high as in the 1930s, the range of Holocene temperature variation was ca. 3 K. This was accompanied by a doubling in precipitation from the thermal minima to the maxima. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme temperature and precipitation events on the Loess Plateau of China during 1961-2007	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; STREAMFLOW; HYDROLOGY; IMPACTS; WEATHER	Extreme climate events often cause catastrophic damage to nature and human society. Therefore, regional assessments in various climates and geographic regions are needed for understanding the uncertainties of the change trends for extreme climate events. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme precipitation and temperature events on the Loess Plateau of China during 1961-2007. Nine indicators (pq90, px5d, pint, pxcdd, pnl9, txq90, tnq10, tnfd, bchw90) were chosen to quantify extreme climate events, the Mann-Kendall method and linear trend analysis were used to test the change in trend and the magnitude, and inverse distance weighted interpolation was used to interpolate the spatial patterns. Results showed that most extreme climate indicators were spatially distributed with obvious gradients from the southeast to the northwest. Heavy rainfall threshold (pq90), greatest 5-day total rainfall (px5d), heavy rainfall days (pnl9) and cold-night threshold (tnq10) decreased from the southeast to the northwest, while simple daily rainfall intensity (pint), longest dry period (pxcdd) and number of frost days (tnfd) increased from the southeast to the northwest. Most stations had monotonic trends in extreme indicators during 1961-2007. However, the number of stations with significant trends varied greatly. Precipitation-based indicators showed more mixed patterns of change and few stations had significant trends. However, temperature-based indicators had more uniform changes and most stations had significant trends. Hot-day threshold (txq90) and cold-night threshold (tnq10), and the longest heatwave (txhw90) tended to increase while the number of frost days decreased since the 1960s on the Loess Plateau. Overall, extreme precipitation events did not change significantly; however, extreme temperature events became more severe and frequent. The results implied that extreme climate events on the Loess Plateau will continue to have adverse impacts, and adaptive measures should be considered for future ecological construction and agriculturally sustainable development.

In particular, the development of amplifier lakes in rift basins after three million years ago significantly contributed to this exceptional sensitivity of East Africa to climate change compared to elsewhere on the African continent. Amplifier lakes are characterized by tectonically-formed graben morphologies in combination with an extreme contrast between high precipitation in the elevated parts of the catchment and high evaporation in the lake area. Such amplifier lakes respond rapidly to moderate, precessional-forced climate shifts, and as they do so apply dramatic environmental pressure to the biosphere. Rift basins, when either extremely dry or lake-filled, form important barriers for migration, mixing and competition of different populations of animals and hominins. Amplifier lakes link long-term, high-amplitude tectonic processes and short-term environmental fluctuations. East Africa may have become the place where early humans evolved as a consequence of this strong link between different time scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This record provides detailed information about extreme, short-lived climatic events during the hyperarid mid-Holocene period. For the first time, we found evidence of continuous human occupation in this area, filling the regional hiatus in the Atacama basin (''Silencio Arqueologico'') between 8000 and 4800 C-14 yr B.P. The transformation of Early Archaic hunters into the complex Late Archaic cultural tradition was an adaptive process. During this time, the site was a local ecological refuge with abundant resources in a generally hostile environment, (C) 1997 University of Washington.

The lake level fluctuations reflect the hydrological conditions in the large watershed of the lake, which in turn reflects the hydro-climatic conditions in the central Levant region. The new curve shows that the fluctuations coincide on millennial timescales with temperature variations recorded in Greenland. Four patterns of correlation are observed through the last ice age: (1) maximum lake elevations were reached during MIS2, the coldest interval; (2) abrupt lake level drops to the lowest elevations coincided with the occurrence of Heinrich (H) events; (3) the lake returned to higher-stand conditions along with warming in Greenland that followed H-events; (4) significant lake level fluctuations coincided with virtually every Greenland stadial-interstadial cycle. Over glacial-interglacial time-scales, Northern Hemisphere glacial cooling induces extreme wetness in the Levant, with high lake levels reaching similar to 160 m below mean sea level (mbmsl), approximately 240 m above typical Holocene levels of similar to 400 mbmsl. These orbital time-scale shifts are driven by expansions of the European ice sheet, which deflect westerly storm tracks southward to the Eastern Mediterranean, resulting in increased sea-air temperature gradients that invoke increased cyclogenesis, and enhanced moisture delivery to the Levant. The millennial-scale lake level drops associated with Greenland stadials are most extreme during Heinrich stadials and reflect abrupt cooling of the Eastern Mediterranean atmosphere and sea-surface, which weaken the cyclogenic rain engine and cause extreme Levant droughts. During the recovery from the effect of Heinrich stadials, the regional climate configuration resumed typical glacial conditions, with enhanced Levant precipitation and a rise in Lake Lisan levels. Similar cyclicity in the transfer of moisture to the Levant affected lake levels during all of the non-Heinrich stadial-interstadial cycles. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abrupt and intense regional glaciations in Siberia during substages 5d and 7d were driven by extreme insolation minima. During substage 9d cooling was more gradual in response to more moderate forcing. The impact of strong glaciation is also observed in the middle of stage 15, where full glacial conditions appear to have lasted for over 30,000 yr during substages 15d, 15c, and 15b, Marine oxygen isotopic stage 11 appears to be the warmest period during the Brunhes in the Lake Baikal record, with at least three substages, A new hypothesis is presented regarding the response of the Lake Baikal BioSi record to insolation forcing, Based on the mechanism controlling modern diatom blooms, biogenic silica production is hypothesized to be dependent on changes in the heat balance of the lake and consequently on changes in the thermal structure of the water column. This mechanism is also sensitive to short-term sub-Milankovich cooling events, such as the mid-Eemian cooling, the Montaigu event during substage 5c, and a cooling which appears to be analogous to the Montaigu event during substage 9c, The continuity of the Lake Baikal paleoclimate record, its sensitivity to orbital forcing, and its high resolution make it an excellent candidate for a new "paleoclimatic stratotype" section for continental Asia.

Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides in this region originate mainly from chemically leached Amazon lowland soils. Concentrations of goethite and hematite in the terrigenous fraction consistently peak during transitions from glacial to interglacial periods, suggesting an increased proportion of erosive products derived from the Amazon lowlands compared to the physically weathered highlands. Lowland Amazon Basin precipitation changes, monitored by the percentage of goethite relative to total iron oxides, lead ice age extremes with maximum aridity during ice growth and maximum precipitation during ice melt. Rapid climate changes over the Amazon Basin may reflect shifts in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone forced by northern hemisphere insolation at precessional (1/23,000 yr(-1)) and obliquity (1/41,000 yr(-1)) frequencies, Variance in the orbital eccentricity bands (1/100,000 and 11413,000 yr(-1)) may be explained by nonlinear amplification of insolation forcing at precessional frequencies. The early response of Amazon precipitation to insolation, ahead of high-latitude ice volume (delta(18)O) at all orbital frequencies, suggests that tropical aridity is part of the chain of events leading to ice ages, rather than a response to glacier oscillations.

The relationship between the oceanic and continental environments has been further examined by the use of other marine proxies (coarse sedimentary fraction, foraminifera.) and by comparison with proximal land pollen records. Heinrich 2 (H2) and Heinrich 1 (111) events were the most extreme parts of the highly variable last glacial period, with the maximum extension of dry steppe on land and the occurrence of cool and dilute waters at the core site. Our study shows that H I and H2 are divided in two distinct phases: one with Neogloboquadrina pachyderma left coiling associated with the maximum input of ice rafted debris, reflecting the in situ release of icebergs and the occurrence of cool and dilute seawater at the core site; the other with dinoflagellate cysts of subpolar affinity, Bitectatodinium tepikiense, reflecting a seasonal control marked by warm summer SST and cold winter SST.

Here we present a high-resolution, terrestrial proxy summer monsoon record for the southeast Asian monsoon, from a rapidly accumulating Holocene loess/soil sequence in the western Chinese Loess Plateau. We use magnetic and clastic grain size proxies to make quantitative estimates of Holocene rainfall and identify variations in winter monsoon intensity. Our record reveals cyclical millennial and multimillennial rainfall changes. As with the northwest African/southwest Asian monsoon records, a short arid interval at similar to 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (the Younger Dryas) and subsequent summer monsoon intensification are recorded. However, at 6 ka BP, the southeast Asian summer monsoon weakened, when the northwest African/southwest Asian monsoons strengthened, and then, from similar to 5 ka BP, intensified, when northwest Africa/southwest Asia became dry. These antiphase monsoonal relationships may reflect competition between sea-surface temperature changes and solar forcing. The intensity of the southeast Asian winter monsoon intensified from similar to 9 ka BP onwards, varying in its phase relationships with summer monsoon intensity. After similar to 2.25 ka BP, extreme climatic instability is indicated by both climate proxies.

This detailed three-dimensional study of the mineral assemblages in mainly the Mousterian sediments of Hayonim Cave incorporates more than 2100 infrared analyses performed on-site during the excavation, as well as diverse analyses in the laboratory. Three major mineral assemblages are identified: the calcite-dahllite (CD) assemblage, the assemblage comprising mainly montgomerite, leucophosphite and siliceous aggregates (MLVS), and a highly altered sediment in which the clays have broken down and silica was released. The boundaries between these assemblages were mapped in detail. The overall picture is one of extreme heterogeneity with sharp variations occurring over distances of a few centimetres. The relation between the D and LMVS assemblages shows that it is a product of post-depositional diagenesis, whereas the altered clay assemblage formed beneath an erosional unconformity. The CD and LMVS assemblages were derived primarily from an accumulation several metres thick of ash deposits produced by humans. Ash is thus shown to be a major component of the sediments of this cave. The distribution of the CD assemblage reflects to a large extent the locations of two active springs/seepages in the cave. The distribution of the CD assemblage also faithfully maps the distribution of bones in the cave, showing that their distribution is a function of preservational conditions and not human activities (Stiner et al., 2001). The conditions that produced the erosional unconformity, also resulted in severe alteration of the clays and other mineral components of these sediments. The erosion process and the fact that the thickness of this altered zone decreases towards the centre of the cave, indicates that the diagenetic driving force was probably climatic. The three-dimensional distributions of the mineral assemblages have a direct bearing on the dating of the case by thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance.

At present, the ASR is delimited approximately between the 500 mm isohyet in the Pampa region and the 300 mm isohyet in the Andean sector (south of 37degreesS) represented by and and semiarid climate types where precipitation can be as low as 200 mm. Mid-Holocene climatic variability affected the regional vegetation patterns and the borders of the ASR. Palcoenvironmental reconstruction is based on comparison of fossil pollen records from different depositional environments. Maps of distribution patterns of plant formations are reconstructed at 2000 +/- 500 year intervals from 8000 to 4000 C-14 years BP. Vegetation changes are mainly explained by changes in the position and the seasonal amplitude of latitudinal shifts of the Pacific and Atlantic Anticyclones and of the westerlies. From 8000 to 4000 BP the eastern limit of the ASR was displaced eastward. The western limit reached the maximum eastward displacement in the southern extreme of Patagonia at 6000 years BP. At this time, at the center of ASR, shrub steppes and the Monte developed, suggesting maximum dry conditions and the establishment of the Arid Diagonal north of 42degreesS, while the present-day Espinal-Dry Pampa ecotone became established. At 4000 years BP paleodata suggest a transitional stage towards the present situation of the ASR. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

We use numerical meteorological and oceanographic models to determine the origin of a sequence of 29 shore parallel sand beach ridges in northeastern Australia. The results suggest that the ridges were constructed by waves and that the final form or height of the ridges is a function of high-energy tropical cyclone generated waves plus storm tides. Hence these landforms archive a nearly 6000 year long history of intense tropical cyclones. The record implies that these extreme tempests occur considerably more frequently than that suggested by the short historical record for this region. The genesis of this sand beach ridge plain has implications for the interpretation of similar sequences elsewhere along the northeast coast of Australia and in comparable environments globally. If other similar sand beach ridge plains have also been deposited by like processes it stands to reason that these long-term records of high intensity tropical cyclones can be used to ascertain a regional scale risk assessment from this hazard.

An analysis of 506 14 C dated fluvial units collected across the whole of Great Britain provides a novel and robust methodology for improving flood risk assessment by geographically and temporally extending the record of extreme flood events. Sixteen episodes of increased flooding occurrence are identified, 12 of which (at c. 11 160, 5730, 4840, 4520, 3540, 2730, 2550 2280 1950, 1290, 660, 570, cal. BP) are recorded in most regions, whereas four phases (at c. 6820, 5540, 1650 860 cal. BP) affected some parts of Great Britain more than others. In all regions large variations in flood frequency and magnitude occurred before forest clearance and indicate an underlying climatic control. During the mid-Holocene there is evidence for a hydroclimatic system switch', which in terms of catchment hydrology in Great Britain was marked by two sudden increases in both the frequency and severity of floods at c. 5000 cal. BP and, most notably, at c. 3000 cal. BP. The marked non-stationary behaviour of the British flood series at these times reflects a regional hydrologic response to large-scale ocean-atmospheric circulation changes superimposed on a pattern reflecting both long-term land-use change and the preferential preservation of later fluvial units. Centennial-scale variations in the occurrence of extreme flood events in Great Britain appear to be a sensitive indicator of past and present climate change in the North Atlantic region.

In order to apply this approach to carbonaceous atmospheric aerosols, it is necessary to adapt pretreatment procedures to the requirements of C-14 measurements. In this work, we followed an approach in which total carbon (TC) is subdivided into fractions of different chemical and physical properties. C-14 data of ambient aerosols from Zurich (Switzerland) are presented for the 2 sub-fractions of TC, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). Furthermore, OC is separated into water-insoluble OC (WINSOC) and water-soluble OC (WSOC). Results demonstrate the importance to differentiate between these fractions for C-14-deduced source apportionment, as the contributions can range between both extremes, nearly exclusively biogenic and anthropogenic.

The southern African sector now contains more than 100 records spanning the last 200,000 years. A number of these relate to the Last Glacial Maximum and Holocene Altithermal, which represent the two most recent extremes in global temperatures. Syntheses of these records have permitted the preparation of preliminary palaeoenvironmental maps for the two intervals. The results provide insights into probable changes in atmospheric circulation as temperatures across the subcontinent rose by 6-7 degrees C. These changes are in agreement with a present-day model which has been developed to explain short-term variations in southern African climate. The results presented here should assist in calibrating models developed to predict future climate change. (C) 1999 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We calibrated charcoal accumulation in sediments from three medium (14-19 ha) and one large (4250 ha) lake with a 300 yr tree-ring-based fire-history reconstruction from central Yellowstone National Park (YNP) to reconstruct local fire occurrence and area burned within a 128 840 ha study area. Charcoal peaks most accurately reflected fires within 1.2-3.0 km of coring sites, whereas total charcoal accumulation correlated best with area burned within 6.0-51 km (r(2)=0.22-0.62, p<0.05). To reconstruct area burned for the entire study area, we developed a statistical model based on a composite charcoal record. The model explained 64-79% of the variability in area burned from ad 1675 to 1960 and was robust to cross-validation. Reconstructed area burned from ad 1240-1975 was significantly higher during periods including extreme annual drought (p=0.05), and area burned varied significantly at approximate to 60 yr timescales (p<0.05), similar to the variability in an independent precipitation reconstruction covering the same period. Widespread burning (>10 000 ha) occurred at 150-300 yr intervals, and at the site level, fire probability increased with stand age (composite Weibull c parameter = 1.61 [95% CI 1.36-2.54]), both suggesting that post-fire stand development played an important intermediary role between climate and fire by increasing fuel abundance and probability of fire spread. Our study illustrates the possibility of reconstructing area burned with multiple charcoal records, and results imply that future fire regimes in YNP will be governed by direct impacts of altered moisture regimes and by vegetation dynamics affecting the abundance and continuity of fuels.

Patterns of human occupation during the early Holocene in the Central Ebro Basin (NE Spain) in response to the 8.2 ka climatic event	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Abrupt climate change; Central Ebro River Basin; Holocene; Migration; Hunter-gatherers; Aridity; Archaeology	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; MONTANE REGION; COLD EVENT; VARIABILITY; RECORD; EUROPE; VEGETATION; FLUCTUATIONS; TRANSITION; EVOLUTION	The Central Ebro River Basin (NE Spain) is the most northern area of truly semi-arid Mediterranean climate in Europe and prehistoric human Occupation there has been strongly influenced by this extreme environmental condition. Modern climate conditions single Out this region due to the harsh environment, characterised by the highest absolute summer temperatures of the Ebro River Basin. The Bajo Aragon region (SE Ebro River Basin) was intensively populated during the Early Holocene (9400-8200 cal yr BP) but the settlements were abandoned abruptly at around 8200 cal yr BR We propose that this "archaeological silence" was caused by the regional impact of the global abrupt 8.2 ka cold event. Available regional paleoclimate archives demonstrate the existence of an aridity crisis then that interrupted the humid Early Holocene. That environmental crisis Would have forced hunter-gatherer groups from the Bajo Aragon to migrate to regions with more favourable conditions (i.e. more humid mountainous areas) and only return in the Neolithic. Coherently, archaeological sites persist during this crisis in the nearby Iberian Range (Maestrazgo) and the North Ebro River area (Pre-Pyrenean mountains and along the northwestern Ebro Basin).

All chronologies reflect July-August temperatures. At the most northern site, Vikran, the response was more confined to July temperatures, resulting in a strong tree-ring and climate signal. The chronology from a steep, south-facing slope at Stonglandseidet showed signs of drought sensitivity. At the most oceanic locality, Forfjorddalen, mild winters appear to suppress tree growth on a decadal scale. Growth variations were consistent between the three sites for 1700-1910 but the amount of low-frequency variability decreased towards the most oceanic site. The seventeenth century, the coldest period of the 'Little Ice Age', experienced three cycles of summer temperatures, with minima around 1605, 1640 and 1680. An extended warm period occurred around 1475-1540. Temperature reconstruction showed secular trends similar to those observed east of the Scandes, but differed in the magnitude and timing of the extremes. At Forfjorddalen, there was no evidence of pine regeneration around 1575-1650. The latter site is likely to have been affected by logging activity in the seventeenth century.

We have made two atmospheric general circulation model experiments: P+T+ approximated the northern hemisphere seasonality maximum near the beginning of 5e; P-T- approximated the minimum near the end of 5e. Simulated regional climate changes have been translated into biome changes using a physiologically based model of global vegetation types. Major climatic and vegetational changes were simulated for the northern hemisphere extratropics, due to radiational effects that were both amplified and modified by atmospheric circulation changes and sea-ice feedback. P+T+ showed mid-continental summers up to 8 degrees C warmer than present. Mid-latitude winters were 2-4 degrees C cooler than present but in the Arctic, summer warmth reduced sea-ice extent and thickness, producing winters 2-8 degrees C warmer than present, The tundra and taiga biomes were displaced poleward, while warm-summer steppes expanded in the mid latitudes due to drought, P-T- showed summers up to 5 degrees C cooler than present, especially in mid latitudes. Sea ice and snowpack were thicker and lasted longer; polar desert, tundra, and taiga biomes were displaced equatorward, while cool-summer steppes and semideserts expanded due to the cooling. A slight winter warming in mid latitudes, however, caused warm-temperate evergreen forests and scrub to expand poleward. Such qualitative contrasts in the direction of climate and vegetation change during 5e should be identifiable in the paleorecord. (C) 1995 University of Washington.

We analyze future projections of climate extremes derived from an ensemble of coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), under a range of emission scenarios. The extremes are described by seven indices based on temperature and precipitation (HWDI, TN90, CDD, R10, R5D, SDII, and R95T). The region of our focus is the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in southern China. Results show a longer duration of heatwave over YRB in the 21st century than today, particularly in the headstream area. More frequent warm nights are also projected in the region. The increases of these temperature extremes under A2 and A1B scenarios are more pronounced than in B1. The change patterns of CDD and R10 are less uniform in the region compared to the other indices. Heavy precipitation events for single days and pentads are projected to increase in their intensity over the YRB. In addition, a larger fraction of the total annual precipitation is projected to occur during heavy precipitation events, i.e. events that exceed the 95th percentile. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Test excavations of Late Paleolithic sites, described here, provide preliminary evidence that the initial occupation of the plateau's extreme environments was by small groups of foragers probably traveling from lower elevation plateau margins. These foragers occupied very short-term camps focused on the procurement and extensive processing of small-to-medium mammals. Five separate occupations date to 13-15,000 Cal yr BP, but limited survey data suggest mid-elevation locations may have been temporarily occupied as early as 25,000 years ago. Full-time, year-round occupation of the plateau probably did not take place until the early Neolithic advent of domesticated animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) interpreted from lateglacial to Early Holocene moraines indicate summertime cooling between similar to 3.9 and 6.6 degrees C relative to today's value, much less than the extreme Younger Dryas cooling registered by Greenland ice cores (mean-annual temperatures of similar to 15 degrees C colder than today's value). This apparent discrepancy between paleotemperature records supports the contention that Younger Dryas cooling was primarily a wintertime phenomenon. Be-10 ages of lateglacial and Holocene moraines show that mountain glaciers during the Little Ice Age were more extensive than at any other time since the Early Holocene Epoch. In addition, 10Be ages of lateglacial moraines show extensive reworking of boulders with cosmogenic nuclides inherited from prior periods of exposure, consistent with our geomorphic observations and cosmogenic-exposure dating studies in other Arctic regions.

Late Classic sedimentation rates are rapid, but an anthropogenically derived colluvium layer is lacking, Initial vegetation was medium semi-deciduous and swamp forest. Forest clearance began 1650 B.C. (Early Preclassic) and maize first occurred at 850 B.C. (Middle Preclassic). Lakeside milpas existed until A.D. 720 (Late Classic) and then were moved from the city center as urbanization intensified and Lake Coba was diked as a reservoir. Coba was at most briefly vacated during the Classic Collapse and was abandoned after A.D. 1240, although some habitation persisted. The paleoecological record matches the archaeological history for Coba, but pervasive disturbance muted the climatic signal, as the Late Classic drought is barely evident. The question whether economic trees were maintained within the city is unresolved, Maize cultivation allowed the Maya to develop a complex society and support a large population, but dependence on maize was ultimately doomed by variable rainfall. Precipitation in extreme years was insufficient to support crops, while native vegetation was not directly affected by drought that devastated Maya agriculture, (C) 1998 University of Washington.

This rise of relative sea-level (RSL) did not occur smoothly, however, but was characterized by the occurrence of one or more episodes of extremely rapid increase. The most extreme of these events has come to be referred to as meltwater pulse 1a, and was initially identified in the coral based record of RSL history from the island of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea. Although it has usually been assumed that this episode of rapid RSL rise was derivative of a partial collapse of the northern hemisphere ice sheets, it has recently been suggested that this pulse could have originated in a dramatic melt-back of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In this paper the arguments presented in favour of the southern hemisphere source are revisited in order to assess the plausibility of this alternative scenario. Based upon the analyses presented, it is concluded that the evidence previously provided in support of the southern hemisphere scenario is in fact unable to rule out an entirely northern hemisphere source for the meltwater pulse 1a. Since explicit evidence does exist that both the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets contributed to this event and that Antarctic ice sheet melting occurred significantly later, the southern hemisphere appears not to have been a prime mover of northern hemisphere events.

Twelve indices of extreme temperature and ten of extreme precipitation are studied. Temperature extremes show patterns consistent with a general warming trend, with most regions showing statistically significant changes for all the temperature-based indices. The regionally averaged occurrence of summer days, growing season length, tropical nights, warm spell duration indicator, warm nights and days have significantly increased by 2.14, 2.74, 1.71, 0.88, 6.23 and 3.59 days/decade, respectively. Over the same period, the occurrence of extreme ice days, frost days, cold spell duration indicator, cold nights and days show statistically significant decreasing trends at rates of 1.61, 3.69, 1.27, 6.57 and 2.6 days/decade, respectively. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) exhibits a decreasing trend of -0.26 degrees C/decade. With the exception of diurnal temperature range, the other temperature indices are strongly correlated with annual mean temperature. For precipitation indices, most precipitation indices show increasing trends in northern Xinjiang and exhibit decreasing trends in southern Xinjiang. Average maximum with 1-day and 5-day precipitation, very wet and extremely wet day precipitation, number of 10 and 20 mm precipitation days, consecutive wet days and averaged daily rainfall intensity show increasing trends whereas consecutive dry days decrease. In the meantime, annual total precipitation shows positive correlations with precipitation indices except consecutive dry days. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Numerous paleotemperature records reveal that the 20th century has been exceptionally warm in the context of the last millennium, and perhaps many millennia. Furthermore, the coldest decades of the last century (the nadir of the "Little Ice Age") were among the coldest times in the late Holocene. Thus, the world has experienced both the warmest and the coldest extremes of the late Holocene within a brief interval of less than 200 years. Extending the climate record back in time enables the underlying forcing factors (prior to global-scale anthropogenic effects on the climate system) to be identified. Paleoclimatic data are essential to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the climate system, without which reliable forecasting of future conditions will not be possible.

Based on the meteorological data from 68 stations in the arid region of Northwest China (ARNC), we analyzed the trend and abrupt change in temperature and precipitation extremes from 1961 to 2010. Results showed that abrupt change in both temperature and precipitation extremes in Northwest China occurred in around 1986. Interestingly, an abrupt change in Index B of the Tibetan Plateau (TPI_B) was detected in 1985. The temperature and precipitation extremes had strong and significant associations with TPI_B over the period of 1961-2010 (R = 0.685, p < 0.01, and R = 0.441, p < 0.01, respectively). They behaved consistently, with a weakening and decreasing trend from 1961 to 1984 and a strengthening and increasing trend from 1985 to 2010. Thus, TPI_B was probably an important factor in the abrupt change in both temperature and precipitation extremes in the ARNC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

However, some questions remain, including the mobility of water through the environment, the seasonal and annual variability of precipitation in the past, and the role of water storage and beverage preparation techniques. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of oxygen isotope analysis in the Andes, and beyond, will be explored using oxygen isotope data from archaeological human enamel and bone from Peru, Bolivia and Chile (c. AD 1-1500). Although strontium isotope values from this region vary according to regional geology, oxygen isotope data do not always follow expected patterns based on known environmental variables, and probably reflect the movement of water throughout the Andes, complicating its use as a tool to identify human migration in the past.

Comparisons with records of historic floods support the interpretation of flood deposits and suggest that most recorded flood events are the result of intense meso-scale precipitation events. As there is no evidence for any major changes in erosion processes in the catchment since the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), we interpret the Allos record in terms of repeated intense precipitation events over the last millennium, with a low flood frequency during the MWP and more frequent and more intense events during the Little Ice Age. This interpretation is consistent with the pattern of increasingly humid conditions in the northwestern Mediterranean region. This long-term trend is superimposed on high frequency oscillations that correlate with solar activity and autumnal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Finally, a comparison of flood records across the northwestern Mediterranean region showed that intense precipitation events in Allos (east of the Rhone Valley) were out of phase with events in the Cevennes (west of the Rhone) but in phase with events in eastern Spain. Supported by meteorological analyses, this suggests an oscillation in atmospheric circulation patterns over the northwestern Mediterranean. (C) 2012 University of Washington.

This paper identifies Rapid Climate Change during the Glacial period as a major factor that influences a variety of cultural, economic and demographic processes during the European Palaeolithic. In particular, and in agreement with many previous authors, climatic deterioration is put forward to explain multiple population breakdown during the European Palaeolithic, as well as to explain corresponding major cultural changes. Taking the archaeological record of the Iberian Peninsula as a case study, the Repeated Replacement Model (RRM) is proposed to explain population turnover in Europe during the most extreme climatic phases of the Glacial, the occurrence of North Atlantic Heinrich Events (HE). The strong aridity of the Mediterranean during HEs appears to have limited settlement refugia to such an extreme extent that communication networks and cultural traditions broke down and were subsequently reorganized under different socio-cultural conditions. The transition from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Aurignacian during HE 4 is one of these cultural turnover periods, which saw the final (macro-scale) extinction of Neanderthals and their widespread replacement by Anatomically Modern Humans. More specifically, and recognizable by comparisons with other climatically extreme Glacial periods (i.e. HE 3, and HE 2), the model excludes the survival of geographically wider (supra-regional) human networks, but it does allow for (micro-scale) survival of scattered groups. From this model, some kind of admixture between Neanderthals and incoming groups of modern humans would indeed have been possible on a small scale. If this climatic scenario turns out to be correct, the most spectacular thing about Neanderthal disappearance might actually lie in the seemingly unspectacular nature of the processes involved.

In comparison to reconstructed and projected temperature change, much less is known about variations in the hydrological cycle Here we present 953 living and historical oak (Quercus sp) ring width samples from Central Germany (51-52 degrees N and 9-10 degrees E), that span the AD 996-2005 period and explain similar to 18-70% of inter-annual to decadal scale June-September drought variance at the regional-scale. Driest and wettest summers common to the tree-ring proxy and instrumental target data are 1934, 1959, 1996 and 1958, 1966, 1967, respectively. Spatial field correlations are positive with gridded summer hydro-climate over western-central Europe Increased mid-tropospheric geopotennal height (Z500) anomalies over the British Isles appear associated with increased Central German drought, whereas negative Z500 anomalies over Western Europe trigger wet summer extremes due to anomalous moist air advection from the west. Although our study revealed estimates of inter-annual to decadal drought dynamics at the synoptic scale, lower frequency trends remain insecure.

Steller rock-ice avalanche in Alaska, and ice and rock avalanches at Monte Rosa, Italy in 2005 and 2007. Deposit volumes range from 10(6) to 10(8) m(3) and include rock, ice and snow. Here we focus on thermal aspects of these failures reflecting the involvement of glacier ice and permafrost at all sites, suggesting that thermal perturbations likely contributed to the slope failures. We use surface and troposphere air temperatures, near-surface rock temperatures, satellite thermal data, and recent 2D and 3D thermal modeling studies to document thermal conditions at the landslide sites. We distinguish between thermal perturbations of volcanic-geothermal and climatic origin, and thermal perturbations related to glacier-permafrost interaction. The data and analysis support the view that recent, current and future climatic change increases the likelihood of large slope failures in steep glacierized and permafrost terrain. However, some important aspects of these settings such as the geology and tectonic environment remain poorly understood, making the identification of future sites of large slope instabilities difficult. In view of the potentially large natural disasters that can be caused by such slope failures, improved data and understanding are needed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. Ali rights reserved.

Role of seasonal transitions and westerly jets in East Asian paleoclimate	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Paleoclimate; East Asian monsoon; Westerlies	SUMMER MONSOON; TIBETAN PLATEAU; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MERIDIONAL TELECONNECTION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MODERN PRECIPITATION; MILLENNIAL-SCALE; ORBITAL-SCALE; PART I; CLIMATE	The summer rainfall climate of East Asia underwent large and abrupt changes during past climates, in response to precessional forcing, glacial interglacial cycles as well as abrupt changes to the North Atlantic during the Last Glacial. However, current interpretations of said changes are typically formulated in terms of modulation of summer monsoon intensity, and do not account for the known complexity in the seasonal evolution of East Asian rainfall, which exhibits sharp transition from the Spring regime to the Meiyu, and then again from the Meiyu to the Summer regime. We explore the interpretation that East Asian rainfall climate undergoes a modulation of its seasonality during said paleoclimate changes. Following previous suggestions we focus on role of the westerly jet over Asia, namely that its latitude relative to Tibet is critical in determining the stepwise transitions in East Asian rainfall seasons. In support of this linkage, we show from observational data that the interannual co-variation of June (July August) rainfall and upper tropospheric zonal winds show properties consistent with an altered timing of the transition to the Meiyu (Summer), and with more northwardshifted westerlies for earlier transitions. We similarly suggest that East Asian paleoclimate changes resulted from an altered timing in the northward evolution of the jet and hence the seasonal transitions, in particular the transition of the jet from south of the Plateau to the north that determines the seasonal transition from Spring rains to the Meiyu. In an extreme scenario which we speculate the climate system tended towards during stadial (cold) phases of D/O stadials and periods of low Northern Hemisphere summer insolation the jet does not jump north of the Plateau, essentially keeping East Asia in prolonged Spring conditions. We argue that this hypothesis provides a viable explanation for a key paleoproxy signature of D/O stadials over East Asia, namely the heavier mean delta O-18 of precipitation as recorded in speleothem records. The southward jet position prevents the low-level monsoonal flow which is isotopically light from penetrating into the interior of East Asia; as such, precipitation there will be heavier, consistent with speleothem records. This hypothesis can also explain other key evidences of East Asian paleoclimate changes, in particular the occurrence of dusty conditions during North Atlantic stadials, and the southward migration of the Holocene optimal rainfall.

Multivariate statistics based on lithological, geochemical and mineral data from the reference site G36 in the centre of the lake were performed to reconstruct the interrelation between lake hydrology and climate variability of the last 11,000 yr. Principal component analyses (PCA) analyses enabled us to extract the three system variables runoff, lake level/water budget and salinity as the major factors which have influenced the lake history during a highly variable Holocene climate. We can also demonstrate that the independent variable total organic carbon (TOC) is not only a function of bio-productivity in lakes under warm-wet climate conditions but more frequently related to surface runoff processes, which can result in over-estimation of pollen types used for climate reconstructions. A combined consideration of all system variables with lithological parameters, catchment characteristics and the local groundwater situation show that lake formation and its persistence strongly depended on local rainfall/runoff and the status of the underlying aquifer. Our results indicate remarkable differences between the early Holocene and mid to late Holocene lake formation, owing to changes in the aquifer system beneath the lake. At about 10,700 cal BP freshwater lake formation starts with extreme runoff events under a wet climate. Repeated dry climate spells of reduced runoff. The overall climate during the early Holocene points to wet conditions with frequent phases of very high runoff and highest lake levels until about 8900 cal BP. Extremely low runoff occurred between 8900 and 8100 cal BP, indicating already dry climate conditions some hundred years prior to the worldwide recorded responses of the 8.2 ka cold-dry event. A second period of major dry climate conditions with generally low but fluctuating runoff, unstable water budget and deposition of aeolian sand lasted for about 2100yr between 7500 and 5400 cal BP. These climate conditions corroborate previous assumptions of a mid Holocene dry period in and north-western China. Increased runoff after 5400 cal BP under wet climate conditions led to a complete refill of the aquifer at about 5000 cal BP and favoured the development of a saline lake for about 3500 yr. In terms of hydrology the time between 5400 and 4000 cal BP appears to be the climate optimum. Compared with the early Holocene wet climate, the mid to late Holocene local rainfall was less pronounced and displays a general decreasing trend towards complete desiccation of the lake. Our results indicate an extremely variable moisture availability in and regions of north-western China during the entire Holocene. Owing to the interplay of the East Asian Summer Monsoon with the westerly waves at the boundary of the summer monsoon limit, variations from dry to wet climate conditions seem to have been more pronounced than in other monsoon regions of China.

Based on daily river discharge data of seven gauges, flow regime changes in the middle and lower Yangtze River between the pre- and post-TGD periods have been investigated. Water storage by TGD has been found to have significantly reduced the mean flow in October. At the same time, the decrease of discharge from the Dongting and Poyang lakes due to climate variability has also significantly aggravated the reduction of river discharge. According to estimates, the river discharge at the Datong gauge during the TGD impoundment period decreased by 18-40% after the reservoir started full-capacity operations in 2008, at which time TGD contributed nearly 8-18% of this flow reduction. By contrast, the water release by TGD significantly increased the river discharge in February. Meanwhile, TGD changed the magnitude of extreme flows, leading to increase of annual minimum flows and reduction of annual maximum flows. Close attention needs to be given to the possible consequences of TGD-induced flow regime changes in the complex river lake ecosystem in the middle and downstream sections of the Yangtze River in the future.

Several bedsets of flood slackwater deposit were identified in the Holocene loess-soil sequences on the riverbanks. They were differentiated from aeolian loess and soils by the parallel and waving beddings and the distinctive stratigraphic breaks separating individual palaeoflood events. Chronology of the flood events was established by OSL dating, checked by archaeological identification of the anthropogenic remains retrieved from the sequences. The results show that successive floods occurred between 4300 and 4000 a BP in association with the abrupt climatic event of 4200 a BP. These overbank floods had the riverbank settlement inundated repeatedly. Another series of extraordinary floods occurred between 3200 and 3000 a BP when monsoonal climate shifted from the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum toward late Holocene dry conditions. The climatic event of 4200 a BP and the climatic decline at 3100 a BP were believed to be characterized by droughts previously. This work provides solid evidence that both severe droughts and extreme floods were parts of the climatic variability during abrupt climatic event and climatic decline in the semi-arid to sub-humid zones over the world.

The Last Interglacial Glacial cycle (MIS 5-2) re-examined based on long proxy records from central and northern Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Last Interglacial (MIS 5); Last Glacial (MIS 4-2); Pleniglacial; Climate evolution; Degree of continentality; N Atlantic sea-ice; Fennoscandian Ice Sheet	MARINE ISOTOPE STAGE-3; SCANDINAVIAN ICE-SHEET; GRANDE-PILE VOSGES; MILLENNIAL-SCALE VARIABILITY; CLIMATE CALIBRATION SET; LATE PLEISTOCENE; POLLEN RECORD; WEICHSELIAN INTERSTADIALS; VEGETATION RESPONSE; WESTERN-EUROPE	Current multi-proxy studies on a long sediment sequence preserved at Sokli (N Finland), i.e. in the central area of Fennoscandian glaciations, are drastically changing classic ideas of glaciations, vegetation and climate in northern Europe during the Late Pleistocene. The sediments in the Sokli basin have escaped major glacial erosion due to non-typical bedrock conditions. In this review, the Sokli record is compared in great detail with other long proxy records from central, temperate and northern, boreal Europe. These comprise the classic records of La Grande Pile (E France) and Oerel (N Germany) and more recently obtained records from Horoszki Duke (E Poland) and Lake Yamozero (NW Russia). The focus of the review is on pollen, lithology and macrofossil- and insect-based temperature inferences. The long records are further compared with recent proxy data from nearby terrestrial sites as well as with the rapidly accumulating high-resolution proxy data from the ocean realm. The comparison allows a re-examination of the environmental history and climate evolution of the Last Interglacial Glacial (LI-G) cycle (MIS 5-2). It shows that environmental and climate conditions during MIS 5 (ca 130-70 ka BP) were distinctly different from those during MIS 4-2 (ca 70-15 ka BP). MIS 5 is characterized by three long forested intervals (broadly corresponding to MIS 5e, 5c, 5a), both in temperate and northern boreal Europe. These mild periods were interrupted by two short, relatively cold and dry intervals (MIS 5d and 5b) with mountain-centered glaciation in Fennoscandia. Millennial scale climate events were superimposed upon these longer lasting climate fluctuations. The time interval encompassing MIS 4-2 shows open vegetation. It is characterized by two glacial maxima (MIS 4 and 2) with sub-continental scale glaciation over northern Europe and dry conditions in strongly continental eastern European settings. High amplitude climate oscillations of millennial duration characterized the climate variability of MIS 3. Mild climate conditions in early MIS 3 caused large-scale deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and ice-free conditions with Betula-dominated vegetation (including tree birch) persisted over large parts of Fennoscandia, possibly interrupted by glaciation, during major part of MIS 3 till ca 35 ka BP. Overall, MIS 5 was mostly mild with warmest or peak interglacial conditions at the very start during MIS 5e. MIS 4-2 was mostly cold with most extreme or peak glacial conditions in the closing phase during MIS 2. This points to a subdivision of the last climate cycle into an early, overall mild interglacial half and a late, overall cold glacial half, each with duration of ca 50 ka. This review also shows that the climate variability in central and northern Europe during the LI-G cycle was mostly in degrees of continentality with major shifts in winter temperature and precipitation values; summer temperatures, on the other hand, remained largely unchanged. It points to the waxing and waning of sea-ice over the North Atlantic Ocean as a possible characteristic feature of the Late Pleistocene. The present compilation, based on long terrestrial sequences, high-resolution multi-proxy data from the oceans, and quantified paleo-climate data, strongly favors a definition of entire Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 5 as the Last Interglacial similar as in the original marine stratigraphy and the stratigraphy at La Grande Pile in France. The proxy-based climate data places the start of the Last Glacial at the base of MIS 4 and the northwest European Pleniglacial.

Instrumental and historical data give evidence of the sensitivity of this domain to broad, regional-scale oceanic and atmospheric anomalies. Our investigation of the paleohydrological variability off Northern Iceland throughout the last 10 000 cal yr suggests that atmospheric forcing alone, through combined changes in strength of the wind stress curl and sea-level atmospheric pressure pattern over the Nordic Seas, is sufficient to explain the recorded changes in origins and dynamics of surface and intermediate water masses. Our biotic proxies, coccoliths and benthic foraminifera, were extracted from a giant piston core (MD99-2269) collected in a shelf trough where sediment accumulated at an excess rate of 2m/kyr. The mid-Holocene from 6.5 to 3.5 cal kyr BP was a time of peaked carbonate production and subsequent sedimentation, and strong water-column stratification with a thick layer of cold-fresh Arctic surface water overlapping an enhanced flow of Irminger/Atlantic Intermediate water. Applying conditions triggering present-time carbonate plankton blooms in the studied area, we infer that a lowered cyclonic activity associated with decreased winter storms and reduced production of Arctic Intermediate Water in the Iceland Sea were conductive of the recorded mid-Holocene water column structure. The opposite situation (warm Atlantic surface water, low vertically-integrated inflow of Irminger water, abutment of Arctic Intermediate water in deep shelf troughs) characterized the early Holocene as well as a shorter late Holocene period centred at 2 cal kyr BP. The Little Ice Age (ca. 0.2-0.6 cal kyr BP) and a short event at around 3 cal kyr BP stand as times of extreme advection of polar waters and extended sea-ice development. A comparison of the recorded long-term Holocene evolution of water column structure off Northern Iceland with climate and hydrological changes in the north-eastern Atlantic suggests that the strength of Atlantic inflow into the Nordic Seas was subjected to a balance between the Irminger and the Norwegian branches. This balance is thought to be mostly related to changes in the intensity and location of westerly winds and associated atmospheric pressure gradients in the North Atlantic. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The orbitally-tuned age model allows the diatom assemblages to be compared with individual marine isotopic stages and substages during the Brunhes. Most of the interglacial periods are characterized by explosive speciation and appearances of new pelagic planktonic diatom species. In contrast, most of the glacial periods are characterized by spectacular extinctions. Three broad periods characterized by different degrees of stability in the pelagic diatom assemblages are distinguished during the Brunhes chron in the Lake Baikal sedimentary record: MIS 19-15e, MIS 15a-11 and MIS 9-5. these periods are apparently associated with the long-term changes in the amplitude of precessional insolation variations. Examination of individual interglacial periods further reveals the sensitivity of the Baikal ecosystem to the regional energy balance: virtually every precessional insolation peak during the early Brunhes is characterized by a unique and peculiar paleo-assemblage. For the first time the siliceous microfossil record has demonstrated such a high degree of sensitivity to insolation forcing of regional climate. Despite the dramatic changes in the pelagic plankton driven by extreme climatic changes, diatoms never went fully extinct during any glacial period. Although greatly or completely renewed during each subsequent interglacial, the pelagic diatom assemblage still managed to return dominated by the new Baikal endemic species. The diatom assemblage observed in modern Lake Baikal, despite being mostly endemic, has formed during the past 50 100 ka and is therefore rather young. These results demonstrate the remarkable capacity of this large freshwater system to sustain the dynamic stability on the large time scales. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Scotland was severely affected by the abrupt climate change associated with the Younger Dryas Stade, during which an extensive ice sheet formed across the west highlands after a period of ice-free conditions. Here, a quasi-three-dimensional, time-dependent ice flow/mass-balance model is developed and applied to Scotland at 1 km resolution. The flow model is based on the driving stress approximation with an additional longitudinal correction term, essential at this scale of operation. Surface mass balance is driven by temperature and precipitation changes and further mass wastage is achieved through an empirically defined calving term. The ice dynamics and mass-balance components are coupled through the equation for mass continuity, which is integrated through time over a finite-difference grid which yields the geometric evolution of the ice sheet. Initial experiments reveal the model to be relatively insensitive to internal parameters but highly sensitive to mass balance. Furthermore, these experiments indicate that Scotland is readily susceptible to glaciation with large glaciers building up on the hanks of Ben Nevis after a temperature depression of 2.5 degrees C, under present-day precipitation. The Younger Dryas is modeled using a GRIP temperature series locally adjusted for amplitude and a systematic series of runs enables the isolation of the climate which best matches mapped ice limits. This "optimum-fit" configuration requires an annual temperature cooling of 8 degrees C and the introduction of substantial west-east and south-north precipitation gradients of 40 and 50%, respectively, to the present-day regime. Under these conditions, a series of substantial independent regional ice centers develop in agreement with trimline studies and after 550 years the modeled ice sheet closely resembles the maximum limits as indicated by field mapping. However, modeled ice continues to expand beyond 550 yr, in conflict with the mapped ice limits which suggest a prolonged period of stability. This discrepancy may be explained by the onset of extreme aridity ca. 400 yr into the Stade associated with a southern migration of the Polar Front, leading to a reduction in atmospheric circulation which effectively starved the ice sheet of its moisture source, preventing further expansion. Introduction of an additional 20% reduction in precipitation to the "optimum-fit" regime after 350 yr brings the modeled ice sheet to equilibrium, substantiating this conclusion.

The average annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter temperatures exhibited significantly increasing trends of 0.15, 0.589, 0.153, 0.167 and 0.347 degrees C/decade over the studied period, respectively. Temperature increases showed a relationship with increasing elevation. In contrast to the temperature, the significance of changes in precipitation during 1960-2008 was low. Regional precipitation for annual, spring, autumn, and winter showed nonsignificant increasing trends of 9.09, 8.62, 1.53, and 1.47 mm/decade. Summer precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend at a rate of -1.5 mm/decade. Under the influence of the longitudinal range-gorge, the regional trend in precipitation was on the decrease from the southwest to the northeast in Hengduan Mountains. During the summer monsoon period, the increase in temperature was 0.117 degrees C/decade, significant at the level of 0.001. Precipitation increased at 6.01 min/decade, but also started to decrease and fluctuate after 2000. There was also a 0.25 degrees C/decade and 7.47 mm/decade increase of temperature and precipitation, significant at the 0.001 level, in the winter monsoon period. The climatic complexity in a mountainous region is reflected by the temporal and spatial differences of climate in the Hengduan Mountains. Compared with other regions in China, the climatic warming magnitude is relatively lower in the Hengduan Mountains. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

It is often assumed that cooling temperatures during this interval, and the impact these would have had on biotic communities, posed significant adaptive challenges to those groups. That assessment of the nature, severity and abruptness of Younger Dryas changes is largely based on ice core records from the Greenland ice sheet where changes were indeed dramatic. This paper reviews climatic and environmental records from this time period in continental North America. We conclude that, on the Great Plains and in the Rocky Mountains, conditions were in reality less extreme. It therefore follows that conditions during the Younger Dryas interval may not have measurably added to the challenge routinely faced by Paleoindian groups who, during this interval, successfully (and perhaps rapidly) dispersed across the diverse habitats of Late Glacial North America.

Reconstructions, which capture between 41 and 50% of the precipitation variance, show that the twentieth century contains the most extreme long periods of wetness and dryness in the past 400 years. Since about AD 1910, the reconstructions are also characterized by an increase in interannual variability and one of the highest rates of extreme events within the last 400 years. A prominent oscillation on the order of 2-2.1 years in length has been identified in the reconstructions using spectral analysis. Quasi-Biennial Oscillations have been shown to be very marked in some circulation indices of the Southern Hemisphere. Although significant oscillations within the preferred frequency domain of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are present in the reconstructions, no clear and consistent responses to ENSO have been observed. Correlations of reconstructions with mean sea-level pressure around South America for the interval AD 1912-1984, reveal the influence of subtropical and high-latitude features of the atmospheric circulation on precipitation variations in northern Patagonia. Droughts result from an intensification of the subtropical Pacific anticyclone off the Chilean coast and the deepness of the circum-Antarctic trough over the South Orkney-Antarctic Peninsula sector. Mean sea-level pressure reconstructions for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Oceans were used to evaluate the temporal stability of the relationships between northern Patagonia precipitation and high-latitude climatic variations since AD 1750. The influence of high-latitude circulation on precipitation appears to be more significant during the twentieth century, which in turn may respond to an intensification of wavenumbers 3 on the mean planetary wave structure over the Southern Hemisphere. Recent increase of precipitation variability in northern Patagonia may reflect stronger interactions between middle- and high-latitude atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere during the twentieth century.

The records of past hydrological events are therefore preserved within the architecture of loess and soils and are protected from subsequent erosion and destruction. Several Holocene loess-soil sequences with the deposits of overbank flooding over the semiarid piedmont alluvial plains in the southeast part of the middle reaches of the Yellow River drainage basin were investigated by field observation, OSL and C-14 dating, measurement of magnetic susceptibility, particle-size distribution and chemical elements. This enables the reconstruction of a complete catalog of Holocene overbank flooding events at a watershed scale and an investigation of hydrological response to monsoonal climatic change as well. During the Holocene, there are six episodes of overbank flooding recorded over the alluvial plain. The first occurred at 11,500-11,000 a BP, i.e. the onset of the Holocene. The second took place at 9500-8500 a BP, immediately before the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. After an extended geomorphic stability and soil formation, the third overbank flooding episode came at about 3620-3520 a BP, i.e. the late stage of the midHolocene Climatic Optimum, and the floodwater inundated and devastated a Bronze-age town of the Xia Culture built on the alluvial plain, and therefore the town was abandoned for a period of ca 100 years. During the late Holocene, the alluvial plain experienced three episodes of overbank flooding at 2420-2170, 1860-1700 and 680-100 a BP, respectively. The occurrence of these overbank flooding episodes corresponds to the anomalous change in monsoonal climate in the middle reaches of the Yellow River drainage basin when rapid climate change or climatic decline occurs. During at least the last four episodes, both extreme floods and droughts occurred and climate departed from its normal condition, which was defined as a balanced change between the northwestern continental monsoon and southeastern maritime monsoon over time. Great floods occurred as a result of extreme rainstorms in summers caused by rare intensive meridianal airflows involving northwestward moving tropical cyclone systems from the Pacific. These results could be applied to improve our understanding of high-resolution climatic change, and of hydrological response to climatic change in the semiarid zones. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Three distinct climate periods can be identified in the Yangtze Delta: Warm Medieval Period (AD 1000-1400), Little Ice Age (AD 1400-1920), and the ongoing well-established Global Warming Period (AD 1920-present). The variability of temperature is of great magnitude, and periods dominated by warm/cold temperature are usually interrupted by cold/warm periods. A comparison of flood/drought variations and temperature variations indicates that there are obviously no fixed modes of climate changes such as warm-wet, cold-wet, warm-dry or cold-dry. However, the results demonstrate that large-magnitude temperature variations usually lead to a higher frequency of flood/drought hazards in the Yangtze Delta. Furthermore, the frequency of flood/drought events usually increased in the transition periods from one climate state to another. The ongoing period of climate change is another transition from cold temperatures during the Little Ice Age to increasing temperatures and variability. This might increase the probability and reoccurrence of flood/drought events and other extreme climate events in the Yangtze Delta. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

A similar to 10,000 cal yr BP (calendar years before 1950) palynological sequence indicates a humid phase characterized by dense swamp forest taxa dated between similar to 9900 and 8700 cal yr BP. The presence of pollen-starved sediments with only scant evidence for semiarid vegetation indicates that extreme aridity ensued until similar to 5700 cal yr BP. The swamp forest recovered slowly afterwards, helped by a significant increase in moisture at similar to 4200 cal yr BP. A new swamp forest contraction suggests that another slightly less intense drought occurred between similar to 3000 and 2200 cal yr BP. The swamp forest expansion begins again at similar to 2200 cal yr BP, punctuated by a highly variable climate. Comparisons between the record presented here with other records across the region imply major variations in the extent of the southern westerlies during the Holocene. This variability could have been caused either by latitudinal displacements from the present mean position of southern westerlies wind belt or by changes in the intensity of the South Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone, both of which affect winter precipitation in the region.

Palynologic evidence suggests that forest composition fluctuated substantially during Oxygen Isotope (OI) Substages 5a to 5e, but physical evidence for this period is as yet poorly defined. During OI Stage 3 and possibly part of 4, inland lakes were larger and the hydrologic balance was wetter than at any time since. Conditions were coldest, and dune activity was maximal throughout the continent, during OI Stage 2, but driest conditions as judged from lake levels occurred at the termination of the Pleistocene, when temperatures were rising rapidly. Lags between changes of boundary conditions and responses of natural systems are clearly seen in Holocene behaviour of coasts and reefs, and the effects of extreme events rather than climatic changes are seen in some sedimentary sequences. Establishment of the chronology of deposits older than about 35 ka, and forging links between the terrestrial and deep-sea records, are major challenges for future research.

Folsom point design and adaptation	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Folsom; fluted point; mobility; technological organization; projectile design; big game hunting	WEAPONRY	The fluting of Folsom points is an elegant technological solution to several problems faced by highly mobile hunters focused on bison procurement. The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinness achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or 'slugs' are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals weapons system designed to mitigated against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

This paper presents results from a pilot core from the Chew Bahir basin in southern Ethiopia that records the climatic history of the past 45 ka, with emphasis on the African Humid Period (AHP, similar to 15-5 ka calBP). Geochemical, physical and biological indicators show that Chew Bahir responded to climatic fluctuations on millennial to centennial timescales, and to the precessional cycle, since the Last Glacial Maximum. Potassium content of the sediment appears to be a reliable proxy for aridity, showing that Chew Bahir reacted to the insolation-controlled humidity increase of the AHP with a remarkably abrupt onset and a gradual termination, framing a sharply defined arid phase (similar to 12.8-11.6 ka calBP) corresponding to the Younger Dryas chronozone. The Chew Bahir record correlates well with low- and high-latitude paleoclimate records, demonstrating that the site responded to regional and global climate changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

This correlation has enabled the section to be related to Muller's (1974) tentative Eemian absolute chronology, and shows that the Hollerup Eemian sediments appear to cover c. 11,000 yr. Our studies show that the onset of the Eemian was characterized by a major lake level rise followed by an almost 3000 yr long period of high, but oscillating lake levels. It is argued that the latter part of this period of highly maritime climate can be defined as the Eemian climatic optimum. This period was interrupted by a few hundred years long phase of low lake level, coinciding with the immigration of spruce, followed by medium-high lake levels. The next c. 3500 yr, coinciding with the Carpinus pollen zone, seem to have been characterized by fairly humid and mild conditions, although slightly more arid than during the preceding optimum. The Carpinus period ended with a more than 1000 yr long gradual lake level fall, and this period of lake level change, concurring with the transition into the Pinus pollen dominated period, terminated with an extreme low lake level event. This 300-500 yr long arid phase coincides with a distinct peak in pine pollen, and was followed by higher but slightly oscillating lake levels in a cooler climate. The end of the Eemian seems to have been characterised by a gradual cooling, until almost pure elastic sedimentation and a marked expansion of herb pollen grains mark the onset of the Weichselian. Based on regional correlations to other European terrestrial and North Atlantic marine proxy records, we argue that the distinct hydrologic and climatic events displayed in the Hollerup record were possibly caused by a combination of sea level changes, changes in the hydrologic cycle and changing oceanic circulation patterns. The latter two may have been triggered by the opening and closure of the Baltic Sea-White Sea connection, the initial build-up of continental ice sheets, and the first major impacts of meltwater induced freshwater in key areas for thermohaline circulation.

Sediments deposited between 12 and 6 ka (radiocarbon) show extreme variations in composition, oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of bulk carbonate, carbon isotopic composition of organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility. These variations reflect changes in sources of moisture, regional vegetation types, precipitation-evaporation balance, ground- and surface-water influx, water residence time, erosion, lake productivity, water level, and water temperature. The total carbonate content of late Pleistocene sediments steadily increased from <20% at the base of the core to as much as 80% in sediments deposited between 11 and 9 ka. By about 8 ka, the total carbonate content of the sediments had declined to about 40% where it remained with little variation for the past 8 kyr, suggesting relatively stable conditions. There are marked increases in values of delta(13)C and delta(18)O in bulk carbonate, and delta(13)C of organic matter, in sediments deposited between 10 and 6 ka as evaporation increased, and the vegetation in the watershed changed from forest to prairie. This shift toward more O-18-enriched carbonate may also reflect a change in source or seasonality of precipitation. During this early Holocene interval the organic carbon (OC) content of the sediments remained relatively low (2-3%), but then increased rapidly to 4.5% between 7 and 6 ka, reflecting the rapid transition to a prairie lake. The OC content fluctuates slightly between 4 and 6% in sediments deposited over the past 6 kyr. Like OC and total carbonate. most variables measured show little variation in the 13 m of sediment deposited over the past 6 kyr, particularly when compared with early Holocene variations. Although the magnetic susceptibility of this upper 13 m of sediment is generally low (<10 SI units), the upper six meters of the section is marked by striking 1 m cycles (ca. 400-500 yr periodicity) in susceptibility. These cycles are interpreted as being due to variations in the influx of eolian detrital-clastic material Century-scale cyclic variations in different proxy variables for aridity and eolian activity from sediments deposited over the past 2000 yr in other lakes in the northern Great Plains, as well as in sand dune activity, suggest that aridity cycles were the dominant feature of late Holocene climate of the northern Great Plains.

The lake's water level is heavily influenced by the watershed inflows and also by the Yangtze River from the north of the lake basin. Assessing the impact of future climate change on the watershed inflows and the subsequent influence on changes in the lake water level is important for developing effective management strategies for local water resources and for mitigation of future droughts and floods. In this study, the large-scale, distributed hydrological model, WATLAC, was applied to the Poyang lake watershed to study the possible impacts of future climate change on both inflow generation and changes in lake water level. The Global Circulation Model ECHAM5 was used to predict future climate conditions for the watershed. Simulations of WATLAC show that annual catchment inflow will increase by 2.9% and 6.5% for A1B and B1 scenarios, respectively, and will decrease by 5.2% for A2 scenario for 2011-2050 compared to that for 1961-2000. Further analyses demonstrate that changes in monthly distribution of catchment inflow will result in an increase of lake water level of 0.10-1.34 m from February to July and a decrease of 0.32-1.31 m from September to February under the three climate change scenarios. It is concluded that climate change impacts on Poyang Lake are expected to be manifested with more extreme droughts and floods in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

In this study, the mid- to late Holocene varved sediments of Lake Mondsee (Upper Austria) were analysed by combining sedimentological, geophysical and geochemical methods. This approach allows to distinguish two types of detrital layers related to different types of extreme runoff events (floods and debris flows) and to detect changes in flood activity during the last 7100 years. In total, 271 flood and 47 debris flow layers, deposited during spring and summer, were identified, which cluster in 18 main flood episodes (FE 1-18) with durations of 30-50 years each. These main flood periods occurred during the Neolithic (7100-7050 vyr BP and 6470-4450 vyr BP), the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (3300-3250 and 2800-2750 vyr BP), the late Iron Age (2050-2000 vyr BP), throughout the Dark Ages Cold Period (1500-1200 vyr BP), and at the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (810-430 vyr BP). Summer flood episodes in Lake Mondsee are generally more abundant during the last 1500 years, often coinciding with major advances of Alpine glaciers. Prior to 1500 vyr BP, spring/summer floods and debris flows are generally less frequent, indicating a lower number of intense rainfall events that triggered erosion. In comparison with the increase of late Holocene flood activity in western and northwestern (NW) Europe, commencing already as early as 2800 yr BP, the hydro-meteorological shift in the Lake Mondsee region occurred much later. These time lags in the onset of increased hydrological activity might be either due to regional differences in atmospheric circulation pattern or to the sensitivity of the individual flood archives. The Lake Mondsee sediments represent the first precisely dated and several millennia long summer flood record for the northeastern (NE) Alps, a key region at the climatic boundary of Atlantic, Mediterranean and East European air masses, aiding a better understanding of regional and seasonal peculiarities of flood occurrence under changing climate conditions.

Prolonged inundation of trees during spring and early summer induces the development of anatomical anomalies (flood rings) that provide a proxy record of extreme floods. Flood-signature records for the Lower Red River basin (LRB) extend from ad 1999 to 1648 and suggest that the Red River flood of 1826 was the largest during the last 352 years. The tree-ring record identifies five of the largest seven floods in the LRB during the last 200 years and documents extreme floods in 1747, 1762, 1826, 1852, 1950, 1979 and 1997. The Upper Red River basin tree-ring flood record extends from ad 1997 to 1448 and contains flood rings for 1510, 1538, 1658, 1682, 1726, 1727, 1741, 1747 and 1762. Factors influencing the formation of flood rings, and hence efficacy of flood-ring records, include flood timing, age and availability of trees, and variations in response along the stem. Evidence from the LRB indicates intervals of increased flood frequency during the mid-1700s, the mid-1800s, and the second half of the twentieth century, and intervals without extreme flooding in 1648-1746, 1763-1825 and 1862-1949. The tree-ring evidence supports the premise that high Red River flows are non-stationary and that past climatic and landscape changes may have influenced local flood risks.

The extreme conditions to which these groups were subjected made mobility a 'resource' in itself. Through the first analysis of Sr isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) in dental enamel of human skeletons from prehistoric burials of the Fezzan (southwestern Libya), we begin to investigate how mobility patterns changed with the onset of the desert. In combining our results with the archaeological evidence, we find that, the transformation in the economy of prehistoric groups correlated with a shift in mobility and possibly kinship systems.

RADIOCARBON			English	Article							RESERVOIR AGES; RADIOCARBON; CALIBRATION; CALIFORNIA; SAMPLES; TERRESTRIAL; CHRONOLOGY; PROGRAM; COASTAL; AMS	Consistently large differences occur in the calibrated C-14 ages of stratigraphically associated shell and charcoal samples from Kilometer 4, an Archaic Period archaeological site located on the extreme south coast of Peru. A series of nine shell and charcoal samples were collected from a Late Archaic Period (similar to6000-4000 BP) sector of the site. After calibration, the intercepts of the charcoal dates were similar to100-750 years older than the paired shell samples. Due to the hyper-arid conditions in this region that promote long-term preservation of organic material, we argue that the older charcoal dates are best explained by people using old wood for fuel during the Middle Holocene. Given this "old wood" problem, marine shell may actually be preferable to wood charcoal for dating archaeological sites in coastal desert environments as in southern Peru and Northern Chile.

In years when cold low-salinity water moves coastward and sea ice is prevalent (i.e., the late 1960s), marine productivity of surface waters is low because the water column is well stratified. In the opposite oceanographic mode, warm, salty Atlantic Water dominates the shelf and vertical mixing results in high productivity. We track these two contrasting modes by measuring the carbonate content of marine sediments, a proxy for productivity, in three cores from northern Iceland. The fjord record (B997-328PC) is anchored by eleven C-14 AMS dates and has a resolution of one sample every 50 yr. Thirteen oscillations occurred over the last 4800 cal yr with an average length of 370 yr; these are superimposed on a long-term decrease in net carbonate accumulation. The Little Ice Age is marked by the largest decrease in carbonate content and in flux, with smaller minima at 2300 and 3000 cal yr B.P. Marked peaks in carbonate (optima) occurred at 2000 and 3800 cal yr B.P. The carbonate record from B997-328PC can be correlated with records on the inner shelf (B997-330PC) and midshelf (B997-327PC), indicating that significant regional changes in oceanography occurred at the southern margin of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The marine carbonate fluctuations closely track temperature reconstructions from the Greenland Summit site for the last 2000 cal yr and show similar, but slightly offset, oscillations between 2000 and ca. 4800 cal yr B.P.

Three recurring patterns emerge from this comparison: (i) all intervals with perihelion passage occurring during northern winter were associated with significant contractions of tree populations; (ii) all temperate-stage expansions of certain Mediterranean vegetation elements occurred when perihelion passage was in summer; and (iii) temperate-stage forests reached maximum extent at times of autumn perihelion. Of these patterns, the first corresponds to extreme dry/cold episodes culminating at times of March perihelion, and the second, to maximum summer temperature and evaporation regimes following June perihelion. The third, associated with the occurrence of September perihelion, appears to be more diffuse both in time and space, possibly reflecting local variations in hydrological regimes. The consistency of at least the first two cases provides some support for the notion that certain recurring vegetation patterns appear to be a result of climate changes linked to specific orbital signatures. This could eventually lead to the development of improved terrestrial chronologies through astronomical tuning. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Late Pleistocene human occupation of the hyperarid core in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Early Americans; Atacama; Late Pleistocene; Hyperarid environments	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PACIFIC COAST; SITE; VARIABILITY; CHARCOAL; AMERICA; CARBON; CAVE; PERU; AGE	Few archeological sites in South America contain uncontroversial evidence for when the first peopling of the continent occurred. Largely ignored in this debate, extreme environments are assumed either as barriers to this early wave of migration or without potential for past habitability. Here, we report on a rare 12-13 ka human occupation from Quebrada Mani (site QM12), a plantless, near rainless landscape (1240 m asl and 85 km from the Pacific Ocean) located in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. This location harbored wetlands and riparian woodlands that were fed by increased rainfall further east in the central Andes during the latest Pleistocene. Excavations at QM12 yielded a diverse cultural assemblage of Ethics, burned and cut bones, marine gastropods, pigments, plant fibers, and wooden artifacts alongside a prepared fireplace. Sixteen radiocarbon dates from site QM12 on charcoal, marine shells, animal dung, plant remains and wood reveal that the occupation took place between 12.8 and 11.7 ka. These results demonstrate that the Atacama Desert was not a barrier to early American settlement and dispersal, and provide new clues for understanding the cultural complexity and diversity of the peopling of South America during the Last Glacial-interglacial transition.

We present Be-10 surface exposure ages on 22 boulders from the Annapurna area in Nepal. The ages improve understanding of the Late Quaternary landscape history and the geomorphological processes operating in this part of the Himalaya. Although our study is reconnaissance in nature, it highlights the importance of catastrophic events, such as landslides and debris flows, for denudation of high mountains. Holocene exposure ages for the Dhampu-Chooya landslide (similar to 4.1 +/- 0.6 ka) and for 600m of alluviation in Kali Gandaki Valley (similar to 2.1 +/- 0.6 ka), for example, indicate the frequent occurrence and extent of catastrophic events and their implications for natural hazards. We also offer an explanation for the differences in Late Quaternary glacial chronologies at closely spaced study sites in the Nepal Himalaya. Topographically controlled and spatially variable precipitation in the Himalaya determines the sensitivity of glaciers to changes in temperature and precipitation. Accordingly, some glaciers advanced in-phase with Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, whereas others reached their maximum extent at times of increased monsoonal precipitation during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and the early Holocene.

What remains unknown is the long-term frequency of hurricane strikes and the effects such storms may have had on the ancient Maya civilization. Our sedimentary study of major hurricane strikes over the past 5000 years provides preliminary insights. We calculate that over the past 500 years major hurricanes have struck the Belize coast on average once every decade. One giant hurricane with probably particularly catastrophic consequences struck Belize sometime before AD 1500. A temporal clustering of hurricanes suggests two periods of hyperactivity between similar to 4500 and 2500 (14)Cyr BP, which supports a regional model of latitudinal migration of hurricane strike zones. Our preliminary hurricane data, including the extreme apparent size of the giant event, suggest that prehistoric hurricanes were capable of having exerted significant environmental stress in Maya antiquity.

Moreover, the absence of human occupations in certain sectors of the region suggested a "Silencio Arqueologico", between 7500 and 5000 BP. However, recent research reveals that places with better conditions of humidity and resources had been used by hunter-gatherer populations during this period. The goal of this paper is to examine the general evidence, and to give information from the Susques area (Jujuy, Argentina) mainly derived from diatom assemblages sampled in fossil marsh (vegas) profiles, and archaeological sites. These data show a local situation marked by greater humidity than that at present, between 8230 and 7550 BP, and 6300-6100 BP. This evidence indicates the great heterogeneity that characterized the mid-Holocene environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Environmental data taken at the collection site (Altamaha Sound, GA) are compared to these incremental analyses. Causal factors in growth band development area defined and related to seasonal growth. Biannual growth bands are visually distinct and consist of alternating dark and light layers in cross-sections of the chondrophore. Variation in water temperature is the principle mechanism producing this variation, with secondary stressors, such as salinity, creating less regular overprints on these layers. Incremental analyses of O-18 indicate that dark bands are usually precipitated during cool months and light bands during warm months. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur during flood events and extreme heat that may cause precipitation of dark bands at any time. These patterns will vary according to local climate and latitude. Absolute values of C-13 and O-18 and time of increment formation vary between individuals of the same bed, therefore isotopic and visual analyses should be performed on large populations. The pattern of isotope variation through ontogeny differentiates between seasonal banding and banding caused by secondary stressors. Visual analysis alone cannot detect such irregular variation, thus the regular patterns of isotope distributions must be employed in conjunction with visual analysis and local comparative collections in large samples to determine seasonality.

It is based on a series of case studies from western Norway, with emphasis on sedimentary facies and radiocarbon dating of the deposits. The present data demonstrate that the colluvial sedimentary successions bear important palaeoclimatic signals related to extreme weather events, and the record of snow avalanches reveals, in particular, a detailed pattern of winter climatic conditions (snow fall rates and the frequency of winter storms). The Late Weichselian record shows some snow avalanching around 12 300-12 000 BP, suggesting occurrence of major winter storms at that time. An overwhelming amount of data demonstrates the dramatic increase in snow-flow processes during the Younger Dryas chronozone, documenting that this phase was characterized by severe winter storms with distinct snowfall rates. The Holocene record of snow avalanching shows in general a good correspondence with the regional record of glacier fluctuations, indicating that both the avalanche and the glacier records were controlled primarily by winter climatic conditions. Snow-flow sedimentation has been recorded from c. 7000 BP (7800 cal. BP), but the records show highly fluctuating winter climatic conditions throughout the Holocene period. Both the avalanche activity and the pollen data suggest a clear deterioration in the winter climate from c. 4700 BP (5400 cal. BP), corresponding with other palaeoclimatic records in Scandinavia. The period between 3900 and 3100 BP (4350-3350 cal. BP) seems to have been one of the most severe phases in the Holocene, documented by a dramatic increase in snow-flow processes-resulting in opening of the local forests. Two phases of snow avalanching have been identified during the 'Little Ice Age' (AD 1450-1920). These data further indicate that episodes characterized by heavy snowfall and strong winds were more frequent in some phases of the Holocene than they are today.

Examination of this record on timescales of decades to centuries shows distinctly different patterns of temperature variation between summer and winter. Over the last 700 years, the summer months show relatively little change, with the coolest summers occurring early this century. The winters, in contrast, show significant fluctuations including a period of warmer temperatures between AD 1400 and 1500 and a colder period centred around the early 1800s which corresponds to the latter part of an era of glacier advance and cold winters in Europe sometimes known as the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). Since many proxy temperature indicators respond principally to seasonal extremes, they will consequently give biased results in the presence of seasonally confined trends. This may account for the fact that events such as the LIA do not appear in some records.

Twelve indices of extreme precipitation were studied. Consecutive dry days decreased and were significant at the 0.05 level, while the other precipitation indices had nonsignificant decreasing trends. The increase and decrease in the aspect of precipitation extreme events showed obvious spatial differences, and change patterns of these indices were not spatially clustered. Different oscillation periods were displayed very clearly in the extreme precipitation indices. Significant periodic variations with periods of a 7-year, a 14-year and a 17-year appeared in the extreme precipitation. The contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation decreased, and the mean trend magnitudes were influenced by the topography for the most extreme precipitation indices from 1960 to 2011. In addition, there were significant correlations between annual total precipitation and precipitation extremes, except consecutive dry days. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

This topic represents both (1) a fundamental aspect for a better understanding of the factors that allowed humans to colonize the middle latitudes of Eurasia, and (2) a reasonable frontier for current Quaternary palaeobiology, thanks to increasing knowledge of regional and local patterns. As for Italy, a combination of palaeobotanical and palaeontological data sets shows on the one hand a general complexity in both space and time, and on the other hand changes of considerable importance within and among the biological communities. These changes had a major importance during the worldwide change in the Earth climatic system known as "Middle Pleistocene Revolution", which according to our data culminates with crucial effects of the extreme conditions of MIS 16. Subsequently, during great part of the Middle Pleistocene, the peculiar features of the Italian territory may have favoured isolation and a local persistence of plant populations and possibly mammal taxa, humans included, as for instance suggested by the corrected chronology of the Ceprano calvarium.

The atmospheric features associated with severe and extreme dryness and wetness reveal two cross-Eurasia wave trains: the Scandinavia-East Asia wave train and the Mediterranean-East Asia wave train. Severe and extreme dryness is associated with an anomalous cyclone over south and southeast Asia, which directs the moisture supply from the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the South China Sea directly eastward towards the western Pacific, thus bypassing the Tibetan Plateau. This cyclone anomaly constitutes part of the Scandinavia-East Asia wave train, which is sustained by the divergence and convergence of the anomalous transient eddy heat transport associated with a more southwest-northeast oriented North Atlantic storm track and a northward shift of the polar front jet in the North Atlantic. In contrast, severe and extreme wetness over the Tibetan Plateau is associated with a more zonally elongated North Atlantic storm track; wave trains excited from there have a high probability to reach the Mediterranean region and to propagate eastward following the subtropical westerly jet. This Mediterranean-East Asia wave train generates anticyclonic anomalies around the Tibetan Plateau and East China, which bring more moisture supply from the Arabian Sea, the South China Sea, and the western Pacific towards the Tibetan Plateau and enhance the moisture convergence there. This paper demonstrates how atmospheric bridging processes affect regional climate variability under present day climatic conditions, which are also relevant for understanding past climates.

Whereas the NAO index series is based on instrumental records of air pressure, the North Atlantic climate 'seesaw' has conventionally been based on air-temperature records, Here we describe relationships between this 'seesaw' mechanism and the Greenland (GISP2) oxygen-isotope chronology of air-temperature variations, as well as relationships between GISP2 Na+ (sea-salt) variations and instrumental records of North Atlantic storminess. The GISP2 proxy air-temperature record is calibrated for the last 130 years with instrumental weather records for West Greenland, while the Na+ series is compared with instrumental records of North Atlantic storminess change. Reconstruction of an annual series of these climate parameters for the last 1000 years shows that during the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' there were no years characterized by high Na+ extremes (high North Atlantic storminess) but there were many years when there were extremes of temperature. Remarkably, there A ere no years of exceptionally low air temperature and high Na+ precipitation at GISP2 between AD 1650 and 1710. a period of time that in northern Europe incorporates the period of maximum 'Little Ice Age' cooling. It would appear also that for the last thousand years the most extreme 'seesaw' winters when GISP2 temperatures were very low and Na+ concentrations were high occurred in discrete clusters and pairs of years.

These midden floras show considerable stability throughout the Holocene, with slightly more mesophytic plant assemblages in the middle Holocene. Unlike the southwestern United States, rodent middens of mid-Holocene age are common. In the Arequipa area, the midden record does not reflect any effects of a mid-Holocene mega drought proposed from the extreme lowstand (100 in below modern levels, > 6000 to 3500 yr B.P.) of Lake Titicaca, only 200 km east of Arequipa. This is perhaps not surprising, given other evidence for wetter summers on the Pacific slope of the Andes during the middle Holocene as well as the poor correlation of summer rainfall among modern weather stations in the central Andes-Atacama Desert. The apparent difference in paleoclimatic reconstructions suggests that it is premature to relate changes observed during the Holocene to changes in El Nino Southern Oscillation modes.

Using volcanology, climatology, history, anthropology, and tree rings, we extend the record by documenting a disaster to Inuit of extreme northwest America. Tree rings indicate the coldest summer in over 400 yr in northwestern Alaska was in 1783, year of the Laki, Iceland eruption. European explorers reported famine and population decrease between 1779 and 1791. Anthropological studies indicate possible famine in nearby areas at around the same time. Inuit oral history describes extreme cold in summer causing famine and death a few centuries ago in northwest Alaska. We postulate that Laki, the unusual, cold-induced tree ring, and the recorded and oral histories of famine and death are all interrelated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme precipitation events were analyzed based on the daily precipitation data of 27 meteorological stations in the Hengduan Mountains region from 1961 to 2012. Twelve indices of precipitation extreme were studied. The results were as follows: except for consecutive dry days, consecutive wet days and maximum 5-day precipitation, other indices of precipitation extreme demonstrated non-significant increasing trends, and most indices fluctuated from 1961 to 2012. Increasing trends in precipitation indices were greater than those in precipitation days. The spatial distribution for precipitation extremes exhibited a declining trend from southwest to northeast, which reflected regional differences and the influence of topography in the Hengduan Mountains region. Furthermore, the relationship between precipitation extremes and elevation indicated that precipitation extreme events decreased with altitude. The extreme precipitation indexes had positive correlations with the annual total precipitation, and their correlation coefficients were statistically significant at the 1% significance level, except for consecutive dry days. Continuous wavelet transform analysis presented significant periodic variations with periods of 2-4 year, 5-year, and 10-year in the extreme precipitation, and there was a 2-4 year resonance cycle with the South/East Asian summer monsoon index. The South/East Asian Summer Monsoon was an important influence on precipitation extremes in the Hengduan Mountains region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The reconstruction explains 35% of the actual January-May PDSI variance during the common period 1925-2005. Split-sample validation supports our use of the reconstruction model based on the full period of reliable observational data (1925-2005). Spatial climate correlation analyses with gridded PDSI data revealed that our PDSI reconstruction represents a strong regional drought signal for Western Tian Shan. Dry periods occurred during ad 1614-1628, 1700-1722, 1758-1790, 1806-1833, 1873-1898, 1908-1936, 1943-1951, 1960-1966 and 1973-1988; while the periods of ad 1580-1613, 1629-1699, 1723-1757, 1791-1805, 1834-1872, 1899-1907, 1937-1942, 1952-1959, 1967-1972 and 1989-present were relatively wet. Our reconstruction agrees reasonably well with the dry and wet periods previously estimated from tree rings in Tian Shan. Significant spectral peaks are identified at 2-5, 60.2 and 213 years. Our reconstructed drought is significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans. The linkages to the North Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans suggest the connection of moisture variations of Central Asia to the westerly circulation and tropical ocean-atmosphere systems.

Bieb and Juniperus turkestanica Kom. from six different sites, in the Hunza-Karakorum, were used in reconstructing modes of regional climate over the past 500 years. All reconstructions were derived from trees growing close to the upper timber-line (approx. 4000 m a.s.l.). Standardized site chronologies, derived from ring-width measurements, display common low- and high-frequency variation that is synchronous between all sites. Since the documented increase in atmospheric CO2 loading, roughly 150 years ago, Hunza-Karakorum trees are not growing as well as they were previously. From the mid-nineteenth century to the present, these trees appear to be alternating between states of more extreme favourable and unfavourable growth periods of different amplitude and duration. Maximum (favourable) variations occurred between AD 1579 and 1603, whereas minimum (unfavourable) variations occurred between AD 1825 and 1850.

Although fires in extended areas of Russian boreal forests have a considerable influence on atmospheric greenhouse gas and soot concentrations, estimates of their impact on climate are hampered by a lack of data on the history of forest fires. Especially regions with strong continental climate are of high importance due to an intensified development of wildfires. In this study we reconstruct the fire history of Southern Siberia during the past 750 years using ice-core based nitrate, potassium, and charcoal concentration records from Belukha glacier in the continental Siberian Altai. A period of exceptionally high forest-fire activity was observed between AD 1600 and 1680, following an extremely dry period AD 1540-1600. Ice-core pollen data suggest distinct forest diebacks and the expansion of steppe in response to dry climatic conditions. Coherence with a paleoenvironmental record from the 200 km distant Siberian lake Teletskoye shows that the vegetational shift AD 1540-1680, the increase in fire activity AD 1600-1680, and the subsequent recovery of forests AD 1700 were of regional significance. Dead biomass accumulation in response to drought and high temperatures around AD 1600 probably triggered maximum forest-fire activity AD 1600-1680. The extreme dry period in the 16th century was also observed at other sites in Central Asia and is possibly associated with a persistent positive mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). No significant increase in biomass burning occurred in the Altai region during the last 300 years, despite strongly increasing temperatures and human activities. Our results imply that precipitation changes controlled fire-regime and vegetation shifts in the Altai region during the past 750 years. We conclude that high sensitivity of ecosystems to occasional decadal-scale drought events may trigger unprecedented environmental reorganizations under global-warming conditions.

It was cold and dry during ice retreat. The diversity and composition of mollusk species indicates that the extreme cold and dry climate was reached during the late phase of Peoria time, in mollusk zone MZ3. Although soil moisture during the growing season at that time was high, the growing season was short and annual precipitation totals were low. Low values of magnetic susceptibility imply relatively rapid dust deposition during this interval. Judging from the current ecological tolerance of the species, no closed forest existed in the area. Only scattered shrubs or isolated tree stands may have been present. The late Peoria MZ3 assemblage compares favorably with the Columella fauna of Europe. In contrast, the early Peoria mollusk assemblages MZ1 and MZ2 compare well with the European pleniglacial Pupilla associations. Based on available C-14 dates from the studied region and on assumed relation of magnetic susceptibility to sedimentation rates, the estimated age of the MZ1 and MZ2 zones is 24,000 to 16,000 yr, whereas that of MZ3 is 16,000 to 12,000 yr.

Annually-resolved lake record of extreme hydro-meteorological events since AD 1347 in NE Iberian Peninsula	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Extreme rainfall; Palaeofloods; Microfacies; Lacustrine varves; Solar activity; Climate change	HOLOCENE FLOOD FREQUENCY; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; SEDIMENT RECORD; NORTH-ATLANTIC; VARVED SEDIMENTS; PRECIPITATION; BASIN; SPAIN; ALPS; RAINFALL	We present an annual reconstruction of extreme rainfall events interpreted from detrital layers and turbidites interbedded within a varied sediment record since the 14th century in Montcortes Lake (NE Spain, 1027 m a.s.l.). Clastic microfacies intercalated within the biochemical calcite varies were characterized and their depositional dynamics interpreted using high-resolution geochemical and sedimentological analyses. Annual number of detrital layers was compared against instrumental records of extreme daily rainfalls providing minimum rainfall thresholds and return periods associated to the identified types of clastic microfacies. Non-continuous detrital layers were deposited during rainfall events higher than 80 mm (>2-year return period) while graded detrital layers and turbidites were associated with higher magnitude rainfall events (>90 mm and >4-year return period). The frequency distribution of extreme hydro-meteorological events is not stationary and its pattern coincides with historical floods from the nearby Segre River. High frequency of heavy rainfalls occurred during the periods AD 1347-1400 and AD 1844-1894. A lower frequency of heavy rainfall was found during the periods AD 1441-1508, 1547-1592, 1656-1712,1765-1822 and 1917-2012. The 20th century stands out as the longest interval within the studied period of very low number of extreme rainfall events. Variability in extreme rainfall events prior to the 20th century is in phase with solar activity, suggesting a mechanistic link in mid-latitude atmospheric circulation patterns that ceased during the 20th century.

In this paper, recent changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation over the western Tibetan Plateau from 1973 to 2011 are investigated. A total of 24 indices that represent extreme climate events are selected and calculated by using daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data. Results demonstrate that most cold-related indices of temperature extremes (frost and ice days, cool nights and cool days, and cold spell duration indicators) show a significant decrease, and that both the coldest night and coldest day have increased during the study period. Warm-related indices of temperature extremes such as summer days, the warmest night and the warmest day, warm nights and warm days, and warm spell duration indicators all have increased. The diurnal temperature ranges show a decreasing trend with statistical significance, whereas growing season lengths have increased significantly. The change trends of precipitation extremes are nonsignificant. Nonsignificant increasing trends are detected for most indices including annual total wet-day precipitation, maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation, very wet and extremely wet day precipitation, and consecutive wet days. However, nonsignificant decreasing trends are found for the number of heavy precipitation days, consecutive dry days and simple daily intensity index. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Pollen, macrofossils, testate amoebae and peat characteristics were analysed in a peat sequence of the Vozka bog (Hruby Jesenik Mountains, Eastern Sudetes, Czech Republic). Past water chemistry and water-table depths were reconstructed by transfer functions calibrated from recent testate amoeba data and long-term environmental averages. Peat initiation started in the middle Holocene (approximately 4200 BC) by the process of paludification, resembling the development of Atlantic blanket bogs. Around 100 BC the vegetation changed from Eriophorum vaginatum-poor fen to the ombrotrophic-bog vegetation similar to the recent situation. A hiatus in peat sequence was revealed between AD 1320 and 1954. It can be explained either by human activities, or by an extreme drought causing decomposition of previously accumulated peat. Local bog development was largely independent of landscape development inferred from pollen records. In the middle Holocene, mixed spruce-elm-hazel woodland was recorded close to the treeline. During 2400-800 BC a gradual transition to mixed spruce-fir woodlands with admixture of beech took place, and from approximately 800 BC spruce and fir became dominant. The major human impact started approximately AD 1230 and was connected with settlement and mining in the foothills.

However, in mountain areas which are highly sensitive to erosion processes and where precipitation events can be localized, past evolution of hydrological activity might be more complicated. To assess these past hydrological changes, a paleolimnological approach was applied on a 13.4-m-long sediment core taken in alpine Lake Anterne (2063 m asl) and representing the last 3.5 ka. Lake sedimentation is mainly composed of flood deposits triggered by precipitation events. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses show that floods were more frequent during cold periods while high-intensity flood events occurred preferentially during warmer periods. In mild temperature conditions, both flood patterns are present. This underlines the complex relationship between flood hazards and climatic change in mountain areas. During the warmer and/or dryer times of the end of Iron Age and the Roman Period, both the frequency and intensity of floods increased. This is interpreted as an effect of human-induced clearing for grazing activities and reveals that anthropogenic interferences must be taken into account when reconstructing climatic signals from natural archives.

They are also generated by phase coupling with atmospheric gravity waves arising through powerful volcanic activity. The AD 1883 Krakatau eruption generated volcano-meteorological tsunamis that were recorded globally. Because of its extreme violence and energy release (greater than or equal to 150 +/- 50 megatons explosive yield), and by analogy with the Krakatau event, it is highly possible that the ignimbrite-emplacement phase of the c. AD 200 Taupo eruption of North Island, New Zealand, generated a similar volcano-meteorological tsunami that may have reached coastal areas worldwide. Tsunami deposits of identical age to the Taupo eruption occur in central coastal New Zealand and probably relate to that event; definitive evidence elsewhere has not yet been found. In theory, volcano-meteorological tsunamis are likely to be produced during comparable eruptive events at other explosive volcanoes, and thus represent an additional volcanic hazard at coastal sites far from source. We suggest that evidence for such tsunamis, both for marine and lacustrine environments, may be preserved in geological records, and that further work searching for this evidence using a facies approach is timely.

One of the most attractive and widely utilized approaches for gaining this knowledge is the analysis of lake carbonate stable isotopic compositions. However, endogenic carbonate archives are sensitive to a variety of natural processes and conditions leaving isotopic datasets largely underdetermined. As a consequence, isotopic researchers are often required to assume values for multiple parameters, including temperature of carbonate formation or lake water delta O-18, in order to interpret changes in hydrologic conditions. Here, we review and analyze a global compilation of 57 lacustrine dual carbon and oxygen stable isotope records with a topical focus on the effects of shifting hydrologic balance on endogenic carbonate isotopic compositions. Through integration of multiple large datasets we show that lake carbonate delta O-18 values and the lake waters from which they are derived are often shifted by >+10 parts per thousand relative to source waters discharging into the lake. The global pattern of delta O-18 and delta C-13 covariation observed in >70% of the records studied and in several evaporation experiments demonstrates that isotopic fractionations associated with lake water evaporation cause the heavy carbon and oxygen isotope enrichments observed in most lakes and lake carbonate records. Modeled endogenic calcite compositions in isotopic equilibrium with lake source waters further demonstrate that evaporation effects can be extreme even in lake records where delta O-18 and delta C-13 covariation is absent. Aridisol pedogenic carbonates show similar isotopic responses to evaporation, and the relevance of evaporative modification to paleoclimatic and paleotopographic research using endogenic carbonate proxies are discussed. Recent advances in stable isotope research techniques present unprecedented opportunities to overcome the underdetermined nature of stable isotopic data through integration of multiple isotopic proxies, including dual element C-13-excess values and clumped isotope temperature estimates. We demonstrate the utility of applying these multi-proxy approaches to the interpretation of paleohy-droclimatic conditions in ancient lake systems. Understanding past, present, and future hydroclimatic systems is a global imperative. Significant progress should be expected as these modern research techniques become more widely applied and integrated with traditional stable isotopic proxies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The calcareous microfaunal record (ostracodes and foraminifers) covers several glacial/interglacial cycles back to estimated Marine Isotope Stage 13 (MIS 13, similar to 500 ka) with an average sedimentation rate of similar to 0.5 cm/ka for most of the stratigraphy (MIS 5-13). Results based on ostracode assemblages and an unusual planktic foraminiferal assemblage in MIS 11 dominated by a temperate-water species Turborotalita egelida show that extreme interglacial warmth, high surface ocean productivity, and possibly open ocean convection characterized MIS 11 and MIS 13 (similar to 400 and 500 ka, respectively). A major shift in western Arctic Ocean environments toward perennial sea ice occurred after MIS 11 based on the distribution of an ice-dwelling ostracode Acetabulastoma arcticum. Spectral analyses of the ostracode assemblages indicate sea ice and mid-depth ocean circulation in western Arctic Ocean varied primarily at precessional (similar to 22 ka) and obliquity (similar to 40 ka) frequencies.

Trend tests are applied to daily temperature and precipitation data from 1961 to 2007 of 192 weather stations. Nine indicators are applied in order to detect cycles of dryness and wetness and are compared with the drought indices Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Tendencies in temperature and precipitation characteristics can be observed. Significant positive trends (> 90% confidence level) can be found for annual temperature, number of warm days, longest warm period, no rain days, and longest dry period. A significant increase in temperature by more than 0.7 K from 1961 to 2007 can be observed in the entire basin and the coastal and far western areas in particular. Negative trends are observed for annual cool days, cool period, wet days, and wet period. Almost no significant trends in annual mean and extreme precipitation are detected. Rain days decreased, and a tendency to longer dry periods and shorter wet periods can be observed. The magnitude of indices describing dryness has increased in the Zhujiang River Basin, and dry periods have become longer while wet periods have shortened in time. Rainfall intensity has increased along the coastline and in the far west of the catchment. This tendency can be partially explained by the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Regarding the high temperature increases, the influences of the urban heat island effect due to urbanization and industrialization, especially along the coast and at the delta, should be considered. The high station density and data quality are very useful for describing detailed changes in wetness and dryness in the Zhujiang River basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The scattered sand dunes are forested under the modern humid, temperate climate regime. Dune types range from parabolic to transverse lee dunes and sand sheets or patches. All point to the presence of conditions marginal for aeolian activity, made possible through wind acceleration on windward slopes, ready sand supply from the weathered sandstone of the plateau and sparse vegetation cover. Modern climate envelopes of sand dune activity in Australia predict that unrealistically drier conditions are necessary to allow wind transport at this site. Only additional impediments to plant growth, such as lower temperature and lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, appear to allow the necessary conditions for dune formation. These observations and conclusions extend our understanding of the extremes of the LGM climate in humid eastern Australia, confirming that the widespread treeless vegetation was also sparse, even in areas that today have annual rainfall above 1000 min.

One of the most spectacular features within the northern part of the European loess belt is the occurrence of well-preserved relicts of the periglacial structures. From a variety of periglacial structures, three types are especially useful to reconstruct the former periglacial environment: cryogenic wedges with primary mineral infilling, cryoturbation and gelifluction structures; and ice-wedge casts. These structures form well-distinguishable horizons within loess-palaeosol sequences and their stratigraphic positions are not random. Periglacial horizons recorded in the Late Pleistocene loess-palaeosol sequences in the study area were formed as a result of extreme climatic conditions and/or rapid environmental changes during cold events of the Last Glacial period. These horizons are noted in almost all investigated sections, and thus they can be used as stratigraphic markers. The number of periglacial horizons and their morphological features vary, depending on their geographical settings and local conditions. The periglacial record indicates the occurrence of four main cold stages during the Last Glacial period. Two earlier stages are recorded in the last interglacial-early glacial palaeosol complex. Their onset was probably rapid. These short cold periods can be correlated with MIS 5d and 5b. The next two periglacial stages most probably correspond with MIS 4 and 2. Only during the last two stages were ice-wedges formed in the northern zone of the investigated loess area. This record indicates the twofold expansion and disappearance of the permafrost during the Last Glacial period. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Major features of the vegetation history at Idavain Lake include herb-dominated tundra (ca. 14-12 ka BP), mixed herb/Betula shrub tundra (ca. 12-8 ka BP), and Alnus/Betula shrub tundra (8 ka BP to present). The Snipe Lake record reveals a brief period of herb tundra ( > 12 ka BP), Betula shrub tundra (ca. 12-8.5 ka BP), and Picea forest mixed with Alnus/Betula shrub tundra (ca. 8 ka BP to present). Comparisons with other pollen records indicate that southwest Alaska has been the location of major vegetation ecotones throughout the last 12 ka years. Northern areas have consistently been dominated by larger growth forms (shrubs or trees) than have southern areas. During the Betula period (12-8 ka BP), a dense Betula shrubland occupied central Alaska, changing to a mixed low-Betula shrub and herb tundra in the south. In the Alnus/Picea period (8 ka BP to present), Picea and Betula trees were more common to the north; Alnus and Betula shrubs more abundant to the south. Vegetation dynamics have been complex at individual sites and across the region. Each site shows both long- and short-term shifts in major taxa, but the magnitude of these changes varies across the transect. In addition, some pollen changes appear to be synchronous among sites (within the constraints of existing chronologies), whereas others are strikingly time transgressive across the region. Similar vegetation dynamics at all sites are: (1) long-term decreases in herb taxa during the Betula period, (2) short-term oscillations between Betula shrubs and herbs during the Betula period, and (3) major increase in Alnus shrubs ca. 8 ka BP. Significant differences among sites include: (1) major expansion of Populus trees in northern but not southern areas during the Betula period, (2) progressively later expansion of P. glauca at northern sites than at southern sites (ca. 9.5-4.5 ka BP), and (3) fluctuation of P. glauca populations in extreme northern areas during the early Alnus/Picea period.

With few temperature station records available in this remote region prior to the 1950s, paleoclimatic data must be used to understand annual-to-centennial scale climate variability, local response to large-scale forcing mechanisms, and the significance of major features of the past millennium such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) both of which can vary globally. Here we use an extensive collection of living and subfossil wood samples from temperature-sensitive trees to produce a millennial-length, validated reconstruction of summer temperatures for Mongolia and Central Asia from 931 to 2005 CE. This tree-ring reconstruction shows general agreement with the MCA (warming) and LIA (cooling) trends, a significant volcanic signature, and warming in the 20th and 21st Century. Recent warming (2000-2005) exceeds that from any other time and is concurrent with, and likely exacerbated, the impact of extreme drought (1999-2002) that resulted in massive livestock loss across Mongolia.

Based on a long-term data set, including water discharge, precipitation, temperature, East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and reservoir volumes in the most recent 60 years, the modes of streamflow changes along the Changjiang and associated factors was discussed. Analysis of streamflow observations by empirical mode decomposition show that streamflow along the Changjiang consist of a trend and four intrinsic components. Trend component in streamflow had obvious downward changes, which could be mainly attributed to dam construction. In addition, increased snowmelt caused by a warming climate led to more water being discharged into the upper reaches. The resultant intrinsic component of streamflow changes can be characterized by two modes using empirical orthogonal function analysis. The main mode represents periodic oscillations in baseflow due to the coupling of a weak EASM and weak ENSO. The secondary mode reflects differences in streamflow changes between the upper and lower reaches of the Changjiang River, which is anti-phased relative to changes in streamflow between the upper and lower reaches. These differences may be caused by a weak EASM and intensive ENSO. Moreover, the combination of a weak EASM and ENSO can lead to extreme flood. Extreme drought years may be significantly impacted by intensive EASM and ENSO. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a chironomid-based quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperatures (T-July) throughout the Holocene for a remote high-mountain lake, Schwarzsee ob Solden, situated above the treeline at 2796 m a.s.l. in the Austrian Alps. Applying a chironomid-temperature inference model developed from lakes of the Alpine region to a high-resolution chironomid record from the lake provides evidence for early Holocene (ca 10000-8600 cal yr BP) T-July of up to 8.5 degrees C i.e. >4 degrees C above the modern (1977-2006) mean July temperature. The reconstruction reveals the so-called '8.2-ka cold event' centered at ca 8250-8000 cal yr BP with temperatures ca 3 degrees C below the early-Holocene thermal maximum. Rather warm (ca 6 degrees C) and productive conditions prevailed during ca 7900-4500 cal yr BP. The chironomid record suggests a climate transition between ca 5200 and 4500 cal yr BP to cooler T-July. A distinct cooling trend is evident from ca 4500 until ca 2500 cal yr BP. Thereafter, the study site experienced its coldest conditions (around 4 degrees C or less) throughout the rest of the Holocene, with the exception of the warming trend during the late 20th century. Beside other factors, the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation seems to be the major driving force for the long-term trends in T-July at high altitudes in the Eastern Alps. Due to the extreme location of the lake and the limited temperature range represented by the applied calibration data set, the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction fails to track phases of the late-Holocene climatic history with T-July cooler than 4 degrees C. Further chironomid-based palaeoclimate model and down-core studies are required to address this problem, provide more realistic T-July estimates from undisturbed high-altitude lakes in the Alps, and extract a reliable regional temperature signal.

Opinions have ranged between the two extremes of Lapita colonisers being either characterised as highly mobile foragers to fully horticultural communities. To further address the question, this paper presents stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data obtained from analyses of human and animal collagen samples from the site of Teouma (Efate, Vanuatu) dated to between c. 3000-2500 BP. The isotopic signatures obtained from 28 samples (23 human and 5 animal), interpreted in combination with isotopic information from several coastal and insular environments, suggest a diet primarily made up of terrestrially derived animal protein with lesser contributions from vegetable produce and inshore marine species. Comparisons linking the isotopic data gleaned from the Teouma individuals and Lapita subsistence patterns reconstructed through archaeozoological and archaeobotanical remains support the hypothesis of a mixed economy, that included terrestrial foraging, inshore marine exploitation and a low level of food production for at least some of the earliest Lapita colonists in Vanuatu.

Tectonic and climatic control on evolution of rift lakes in the Central Kenya Rift, East Africa	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							NAKURU-ELMENTEITA BASIN; HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES; WATER-BUDGET; KYR BP; NAIVASHA; VALLEY; HISTORY; SEDIMENTATION; PLEISTOCENE; EQUATORIAL	The long-term histories of the neighboring Nakuru-Elmenteita and Naivasha lake basins in the Central Kenya Rift illustrate the relative importance of tectonic versus climatic effects on rift-lake evolution and the formation of disparate sedimentary environments. Although modem climate conditions in the Central Kenya Rift are very similar for these basins, hydrology and hydrochemistry of present-day lakes Nakuru, Elmenteita and Naivasha contrast dramatically due to tectonically controlled differences in basin geometries, catchment size, and fluvial processes. In this study, we use eighteen (14)C and (40)Ar/(39)Ar dated fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary sections to unravel the spatiotemporal evolution of the lake basins in response to tectonic and climatic influences. We reconstruct paleoclimatic and ecological trends recorded in these basins based on fossil diatom assemblages and geologic field mapping. Our study shows a tendency towards increasing alkalinity and shrinkage of water bodies in both lake basins during the last million years. Ongoing volcano-tectonic segmentation of the lake basins, as well as reorganization of upstream drainage networks have led to contrasting hydrologic regimes with adjacent alkaline and freshwater conditions. During extreme wet periods in the past, such as during the early Holocene climate optimum, lake levels were high and all basins evolved toward freshwater systems. During drier periods some of these lakes revert back to alkaline conditions, while others maintain freshwater characteristics. Our results have important implications for the use and interpretation of lake sediment as climate archives in tectonically active regions and emphasize the need to deconvolve lacustrine records with respect to tectonics versus climatic forcing mechanisms.

Evidence from the pollen and sediment chemistry records	HOLOCENE			English	Article						Hungary; Holocene; palynology; geochemistry; Neolithic; Copper Age; vegetation history; woodland management	HISTORY; EUROPE	A 4.5 m sedimentary sequence collected from Sirok Nyirjes To in northeast Hungary reveals a record of environmental change from 10000 BP to the present day. Palaeoenvironmental analyses (pollen, charcoal, geochemistry and physical properties) of the sequence reveal an environment where parkland composed of coniferous and broadleaved taxa existing at the start of the Holocene developed rapidly into deciduous broadleaved forest. From c. 8200 cal. BP, Corylus expanded rapidly and dominated the pollen assemblage until a series of fluctuations involving Corylus and Carpinus betulus which resulted in changes to the forest composition. These changes occurred over timescales of 72-288 years and are attributed to Neolithic and Copper Age forest use, perhaps under a woodland management regime such as coppicing or pollarding. Sedimentological and geochemical records for this period are stable, suggesting that soil erosion was not occurring. Natural forest processes resumed following Copper Age settlement shifts but were subject to further, more extreme impacts during the Hungarian migrations and conquests of the 1st millennium AD. Landscape clearance is not evident until c. 2000 cal. BP, but was of insufficient intensity to initiate soil erosion.

Vegetation and environmental responses to climate forcing during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation in the East Carpathians: attenuated response to maximum cooling and increased biomass burning	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						LGM; Romania; Pollen; XRF; Magnetic susceptibility; Biomass burning; Grass steppe; Boreal and temperate tree refugia	CHLOROPLAST DNA VARIATION; ICE-CORE RECORDS; CENTRAL-EUROPE; ROMANIAN CARPATHIANS; LATE PLEISTOCENE; POSTGLACIAL RECOLONIZATION; FOREST VEGETATION; SOUTHERN EUROPE; POLLEN ANALYSIS; MODERN ANALOGS	The Carpathian Mountains were one of the main mountain reserves of the boreal and cool temperate flora during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in East-Central Europe. Previous studies demonstrated Lateglacial vegetation dynamics in this area; however, our knowledge on the LGM vegetation composition is very limited due to the scarcity of suitable sedimentary archives. Here we present a new record of vegetation, fire and lacustrine sedimentation from the youngest volcanic crater of the Carpathians (Lake St Anne, Lacul Sfanta Ana, Szent-Anna-to) to examine environmental change in this region during the LGM and the subsequent deglaciation. Our record indicates the persistence of boreal forest steppe vegetation (with Pinus, Betula, Salix, Populus and Picea) in the foreland and low mountain zone of the East Carpathians and Juniperus shrubland at higher elevation. We demonstrate attenuated response of the regional vegetation to maximum global cooling. Between similar to 22,870 and 19,150 cal yr BP we find increased regional biomass burning that is antagonistic with the global trend. Increased regional fire activity suggests extreme continentality likely with relatively warm and dry summers. We also demonstrate xerophytic steppe expansion directly after the LGM, from similar to 19,150 cal yr BP, and regional increase in boreal woodland cover with Pinus and Betula from 16,300 cal yr BP. Plant macrofossils indicate local (950 m a.s.1.) establishment of Betula nana and Betula pubescens at 15,150 cal yr BP, Pirzus sylvestris at 14,700 cal yr BP and Larix decidua at 12,870 cal yr BP. Pollen data furthermore support population genetic inferences regarding the regional presence of some temperate deciduous trees during the LGM (Fagus sylvatica, Coiylus avellana, Fraxinus excelsior). Our sedimentological data also demonstrate intensified aeolian dust accumulation between 26,000 and 20,000 cal yr BP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Magyari, E.

QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; SEDIMENT LOAD; RIVER; RESERVOIR; DISCHARGE	Dam operations have had significant impact on the natural flow regimes in most of the world large rivers. The Mekong River in Southeast Asia was one of the few remaining rather intact large river basins. The natural flow regime, however, is changing due to the recent hydropower development of many large dams in both mainstream and tributaries. The impacts of dams operation on the natural flows and the recent droughts in particular were examined in Chiang Saen, close to the Chinese dams on the Mekong River mainstream. We used the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) to examine the impacts of dam operation on water discharge. The water discharge was obviously lower in the dry seasons (1-, 3- and 7-day minima) in the post-dam period (1992-2010) than in the pre-dam period (1960-1991). The water discharge in the wet seasons (1-, 3- and 7-day maxima) was marginally lower in the post-dam period. The monthly mean value averaged over the entire post-dam period was higher in July (an increase of 15%), but lower in August (a decrease of 9%) than in the pre-dam period, suggesting the reservoirs released more water for hydropower generation in July, but started to store water in August. The early monsoon withdrawal and low monsoon rainfall in 2009, as well as very low rainfall in the dry season of 2010 resulted in 2010 severe drought in Yunnan and the lower Mekong basin. Water flows at Chiang Saen were dominated by precipitation upstream, but the existing reservoirs (Manwang, Dachaoshan, Jinhong, and Xiaowan until 2010) have altered the water flow to a certain degree at Chiang Saen. However, climate change, especially temperature increase of 0.2-0.4 C degrees/10 years and glacial melting in the river origin area, and more importantly, recent extreme weather events, could put the Chinese reservoirs at the center of debate.

We compile 283 U/Th dates on 21 stalagmites from six cave systems in the NW coast of Spain to evaluate if there are patterns in stalagmite growth that are evidence of climatic forcing. In the oldest stalagmites, from marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 7-5, growth persists through the glacial period. Hiatuses and major reductions in growth rate occur during extreme minima in summer insolation. Stalagmites active during the last interglaciation cease growth at the MIS 5-4 boundary (74 ka), when regional sea-surface temperature cooled significantly. During MIS 3, only two stalagmites grew; rates were highest between 50 and 60 ka during the maximum in summer insolation. One stalagmite grew briefly at 41 ka, 36.5 and 28.6 ka, all during warm phases of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. A pronounced Holocene optimum in stalagmite growth occurs from 9 to 6 ka. The cessation of most growth by 4.1 ka, coincident with broad increases in aridity over the Mediterranean and areas influenced by the North African Monsoon, suggest that regions such as NW Spain, with dominant Atlantic moisture sources, also experienced increased aridity at this time.

By A. C. 1000, most inhabitable islands were occupied and inter-island voyaging was a vital link sustaining small populations on ecologically-marginal landfalls-islands that pushed the capabilities of Polynesian colonization to their limits. Several islands throughout Polynesia evidence prehistoric occupation yet were not inhabited at European contact. Henderson Island, SE Polynesia, with its extreme environmental conditions, typifies such so-called ''mystery islands.'' The results of a recent multidisciplinary study are summarized, which include an island-wide survey, test excavations, and the recovery of the largest artifact, faunal, and floral assemblages from this part of Polynesia. These data provide new evidence for ascertaining the role of inter-island voyaging in sustaining isolated populations, and bow human colonists altered insular landscapes and caused faunal extinctions. It is argued that Henderson Island prehistory is most profitably examined within the context of regional dynamics.

The 1.5-ka varved record of Lake Montcortes (southern Pyrenees, NE Spain)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Biogenic varves; Human impact; Climate changes; Medieval Climate Anomaly; Little Ice Age; Pre-Pyrenees	SEDIMENT RECORD; HISTORY; EUTROPHICATION; VARIABILITY; MILLENNIUM; MIGRATION; HOLOCENE; DIATOMS; PHASES; IMPACT	The karstic Lake Montcortes sedimentary sequence spanning the last 1548 yr constitutes the first continuous, high-resolution, multi-proxy varved record in northern Spain. Sediments consist of biogenic varves composed of calcite, organic matter and detrital laminae and turbidite layers. Calcite layer thickness and internal sub-layering indicate changes in water temperature and seasonality whereas the frequency of detrital layers reflects rainfall variability. Higher temperatures occurred in Lake Montcortes in AD 555-738, 825-875, 1010-1322 and 1874-present. Lower temperatures and prolonged winter conditions were recorded in AD 1446-1598, 1663-1711 and 1759-1819. Extreme and multiple precipitation events dominated in AD 571-593, 848-922, 987-1086, 1168-1196, 1217-1249, 1444-1457, 1728-1741 and 1840-1875, indicating complex hydrological variability in NE Spain since AD 463. The sedimentary record of Lake Montcortes reveals a short-term relation between rainfall variability and the detrital influx, pronounced during extended periods of reduced anthropogenic influences. In pre-industrial times, during warm climate episodes, population and land use increased in the area. After the onset of the industrialization, the relationship between climate and human activities decoupled and population dynamics and landscape modifications were therefore mostly determined by socio-economic factors.

Extreme Nile floods and famines in Medieval Egypt (AD 930-1500) and their climatic implications	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Conference on Dark Nature - Rapid Nature Change and Human Response	SEP 06-10, 2005	Como, ITALY	ICSU			NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; WARM PERIOD; HOLOCENE; RAINFALL; CIRCULATION; MONSOON; OCEAN	Nile gauge records of variations in Nile floods from the 9th century to the 15th century AD reveal pronounced episodes of low Nile and high Nile flood discharge. Historical data reveal that this period was also characterized by the worst known famines on record. Exploratory comparisons of variations in Nile flood discharge with high-resolution data on sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic climate from three case studies suggest that rainfall at the source of the Nile was influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation. However, there are apparently flip-flop reversals from periods when variations in Nile flood discharge are positively related to North Atlantic warming to periods where the opposite takes place. The key transitions occur at-AD 900, 1010, 1070, 1180, 1350 and 1400. The putative flip-flop junctures, which require further confirmation, appear to be quite rapid and some seem to have had dramatic effects on Nile flood discharge, especially if they recurred at short intervals, characteristic of the period from the 9th to the 14th century, coincident with the so-called Medieval Warm Period. The transition from one state to the other was characterized by incidents of low, high or a succession of both low and high extreme floods. The cluster of extreme floods was detrimental causing famines and economic disasters that are unmatched over the last 2000 years. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

It is suggested to reflect changes not just in tool form and innovative shaping, but also in planning depth, landscape use and social structures. This paper examines in detail the chronology of the first Acheulian industries in north-west Europe with the earliest sites from c. 700 ka through to later sites at c. 400 ka. It asks whether evidence from these sites can further our understanding of how the Acheulian and the bifacial technology emerged in this region, but more critically whether it was the underlying behavioural changes that enabled the more sustained occupation of northern latitudes. In particular the paper assesses whether cultural signatures can be identified and whether this reflects changes in group dynamics and social structures that could be a fundamental aspect of surviving in more seasonal, cooler climates. To achieve this, the industries are examined in their chronological and biogeographical framework and compared over time and with the south European sites. The study discusses the influencing factors on variability such as raw material, site function, palaeogeography and questions regarding the background conditions for the introduction of the bifacial technology in Europe. The flexibility in behaviour makes the identification of cultural traditions across Europe difficult due to the situational responses of the early hominins. The large geographical area, the long time period, the fragmented record and a chronology, that still needs improvement, all mean that only glimpses of traditions can be identified, usually at a very local level. However, due to the more extreme climatic cycles of northern Europe, compared to southern Europe, it seems inevitable that populations colonized repeatedly from south to north as climate warmed and retreated or populations became locally extinct as climate cooled. Although there are broad similarities in technology, attempts to identify cultural links have been hampered by the greater variety of raw materials in the south compared to the generally better quality siliceous raw materials in the north. Broad patterns over time might be discernible, with perhaps a refinement through time, but there are also many exceptions to this observation. What seems clearer are other technological innovations from 600 to 500 ka that seem part of an Acheulian package and might reflect other changes in human cultures and societies. It is suggested that these developments were a critical part of more sustained occupation of northern latitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results show that wet day precipitation, consecutive wet days and numbers of heavy precipitation days exhibit non-significant decreasing trends in the study area. Consecutive dry days and simple daily intensity index have increased and are significant at the 95% level, while other extreme precipitation indexes have non-significant increasing trends. Spatial changes of precipitation extreme indices show obvious differences, and they are not clustered either. On the whole, the number of rainy days has decreased over the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and hilly Guangxi, and the spatial distribution reflects the regional climatic complexity. Continuous wavelet transform analysis indicates that there are significant periodic variations with periods of similar to 7 and similar to 14 years in extreme precipitation, and that there is also a 6-year period and a 14-year period with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), respectively, which are very consistent. The PDO and SOI are important influential factors for precipitation. In addition, except for consecutive dry days, the other extreme precipitation indices have significant correlations with annual precipitation. Large scale atmospheric circulation changes derived from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis reveals that a strengthening anticyclonic circulation, increasing geopotential height, weakening monsoonal flow, and vapor transportation over the Eurasian continent have contributed to the changes in precipitation extremes in southern China.

YR BP; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; TESTATE AMEBAS; WALTON MOSS; SLUGGAN BOG; ICE-CORE; PALEOCLIMATE RECORDS	Palaeoenvironmental and archaeological data from several regions around the world show evidence of a multi-centennial climatic event occurring approximately 4200 cal yr BP (4.2 ka). Whilst the climatic change and/or impact of the 4.2 ka event is clear in certain regions, such as western Asia, evidence for the event has yet to be fully evaluated in northwest Europe. This study presents high-resolution, multi-proxy palaeoclimate records from sites in Northern Ireland, ideally located for an objective examination of the nature of the event in Great Britain and Ireland within the broader context of mid-Holocene climate change c. 6.5-2.5 ka. The peatlands of northwest Europe possess considerable potential for the examination of climatic change in the North Atlantic region, demonstrated by the range of palaeohydrological proxy data generated during this study (peat humification, plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analyses) supported by a high-resolution chronology (including comprehensive AMS C-14 and tephrochronology). The inter-site testate amoebae reconstructions appear coherent and were combined to produce a regional climatic record, in marked contrast to the plant macrofossil and peat humification records that appear climatically complacent. The testate amoebae reconstruction, however, provides no compelling evidence for a 42 ka event signal and is consistent with previously reported studies from across northwest Europe, suggesting the origin and impact of this event is spatially complex.

This paper, co-authored by members of the PAGES Africa2k Working Group, synthesises published material to produce a record of temperature variability for Africa as a whole spanning the last 2000 years. The paper focuses on temperature variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA), Little Ice Age' (LIA) and late 19th-early 21st centuries. Warmer conditions during the MCA are evident in records from Lake Tanganyika in central Africa, the Ethiopian Highlands in northeastern Africa, and Cango Cave, the Kuiseb River and Wonderkrater in southern Africa. Other records covering the MCA give ambiguous signals. Warming appears to have been greater during the early MCA (c. ad 1000) in parts of southern Africa and during the later MCA (from ad 1100) in Namibia, Ethiopia and at Lake Tanganyika. LIA cooling is evident in Ethiopian and southern African pollen records and in organic biomarker data from Lake Malawi in southeastern tropical Africa, while at Lake Tanganyika the temperature depression appears to have been less consistent. A warming trend in mean annual temperatures is clearly evident from historical and instrumental data covering the late 19th to early 21st centuries. General warming has occurred over Africa since the 1880s punctuated only by a period of cooling in the mid 20th century. The rate of temperature increase appears to have accelerated towards the end of the 20th century. The few long high-resolution proxy records that extend into the late 20th century indicate that average annual temperatures were 1-2 degrees C higher in the last few decades than during the MCA.

A combination of high-resolution seismic surveying, detailed sediment microfacies analysis, non-destructive core-scanning techniques and AMS C-14 dating of terrestrial macrofossils was used to detect and date these events. Based on this approach, our data shed light on past seismic activity in the vicinity of Lake Iseo and the influence of climate variability and human impact on allochthonous detrital matter flux into the lake. The 19 m long investigated sediment sequence of faintly layered lake marl contains frequent centimetre-to decimetre-scale sandy-silty detrital layers. During the early to mid Holocene, these small-scale detrital layers, reflecting sediment supply by extreme surface runoff events, reveal a distinct centennial-scale recurrence pattern. This is in accordance with regional lake-level highstands and minima in solar activity and thus apparently mainly climate-controlled. After c. 4200 cal. yr BP, intervals of high detrital flux occasionally also correlate with periods of enhanced human settlement activity. In consequence, deposition of small-scale detrital layers during the late Holocene apparently reflects a rather complex interplay between climatic and anthropogenic influences on catchment erosion processes. Besides the small-scale detrital layers, five up to 2.40 m thick large-scale detrital event layers, composed of basal mass-wasting deposits overlain by large-scale turbidites, were identified, which are supposed to be triggered by strong earthquakes. The uppermost large-scale event layer can be correlated to a documented M-w=6.0 earthquake in ad 1222 in Brescia. The four other large-scale event layers are supposed to correspond to previously undocumented local earthquakes. These occurred around 350 (BC), 570 (BC), 2540 (BC) and 6210 (BC) and most probably also reached magnitudes in the order of M-w = 5.0-6.5.

Establishing an accurate and reliable chronology for these deposits has fundamental implications for understanding the patterns of human evolution and dispersal. This paper explores the potential application of a new methodology of amino acid racemization (AAR) dating of shell middens and describes a simple protocol to test the suitability of different molluscan species. This protocol provides a preliminary test for the presence of an intracrystalline fraction of proteins (by bleaching experiments and subsequent heating at high temperature), checking the closed system behaviour of this fraction during diagenesis. Only species which pass both tests can be considered suitable for further studies to obtain reliable age information. This amino acid geochronological technique is also applied to midden deposits at two latitudinal extremes: Northern Scotland and the Southern Red Sea. Results obtained in this study indicate that the application of this new method of AAR dating of shells has the potential to aid the geochronological investigation of shell mounds in different areas of the world.

Optically stimulated luminescence and C-14 ages from nearby terraced aggradational alluvial deposits indicate a paucity of large floods in the Late Pleistocene and at least five large flood events in the last c. 6 kyr, interpreted to mark an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the middle Holocene despite overall reduced EP. Increased EP in south-central Australia during the early to middle Holocene resulted from (1) decreased El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, which reduced the frequency of El Nino-triggered droughts, (2) the prevalence of a more La Nina-like mean climatic state in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which increased available atmospheric moisture, and (3) a southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICTZ), which allowed tropical summer storms associated with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM) to penetrate deeper into the southern part of the continent. The onset of heightened aridity and apparent increase in large flood frequency at c. 5 ka is interpreted to indicate the establishment of an ENSO-like climate in arid Australia in the late Holocene, consistent with a variety of other terrestrial and marine proxies. The broad synchroneity of Holocene climate change across much of the Australian continent with changes in ENSO behavior suggests strong teleconnections amongst ENSO and the other climate systems such as the ASM, Indian Ocean Dipole, and Southern Annular Mode.

These oscillations can be correlated with tree-ring-based oscillations in Sierra Nevada snowpack. Comparison of a tree-ring-based reconstruction of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index (D'Arrigo et al., 2001) with a coral-based reconstruction of Subtropical South Pacific sea-surface temperature (Linsley et al., 2000) indicates a high degree of correlation between the two records during the past 300 yr. This suggests that the PDO has been a pan-Pacific phenomena for at least the past few hundred years. Major oscillations in the hydrologic balance of the Sierra Nevada correspond to changes in the sign of the PDO with extreme droughts occurring during PDO maxima. Four droughts centered on A.D. 1710, 1770, 1850, and 1930 indicate PDO-related drought reoccurrence intervals ranging from 60 to 80 yr. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

A simple ice-sheet model has been used to determine LGM climate conditions by finding the ice-sheet mass-balance configuration that permits model results to match with geological data relating to the extent of LGM ice cover. These conditions are compared with Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) calculations of the climate at the LGM, which reveal the meteorological conditions associated with the ice-sheet mass-balance. The western margin of Scandinavia is characterised by a maritime climate, influenced by the nearby warm, seasonally sea-ice free, ocean conditions. However, further east, the warming effect of the North Atlantic diminishes and an extreme polar desert climate dominates across the Kara Sea similar to East Antarctica today. The LGM climate that we establish is in contrast to many previous reconstructions involving snow-laden warm westerly winds originating from the North Atlantic affecting the entire Eurasian Arctic. Severely cold conditions across the Eurasian Arctic are compatible with a stable circulation cell over the Kara Sea that isolates the region climatically, and/or cold dry westerly winds from the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet that flow across the rest of the Eurasian Arctic.

There was a statistically significant decrease of 0.24 m/s per decade in the annual mean wind speed during the period 1969-2009. The decreasing trend was faster (0.37 m/s/10a) during 1969-2000. Between 2001 and 2009, there was a significant increase. The pattern of seasonal changes was similar. Stations with stronger, significant decreasing trends were mainly on the Xizang Plateau, the Hengduan Mountains and the Yunnan Plateau, and stations with significant increasing trends were mainly in the Sichuan basin, indicating the influence of altitude on wind speed. Surface wind speeds in southwestern China have been affected in recent years by both the changed large-scale atmospheric circulation and regional and global warming, while the weakening surface pressure gradient between high and low latitudinal regions may be an important contributor to the decreased wind speed under the asymmetric warming during 1969-2009. The data indicated a positive correlation between wind speed and sunshine duration suggesting another possible influencing factor.

From cold to cool in northernmost Norway: Lateglacial and early Holocene multi-proxy environmental and climate reconstructions from Jansvatnet, Hammerfest	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Northern Norway; Diatoms; Chironomids; Macrofossils; Pollen; Temperature reconstructions; Palaeolimnology; Cold interstadial; Lateglacial aridity; Tree-birch immigration	YOUNGER DRYAS CLIMATE; SW BARENTS SEA; WESTERN NORWAY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; KRAKENES LAKE; TREE-LINE; AIR TEMPERATURES; EUROPEAN RUSSIA; VARANGER-PENINSULA; DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES	A multi-proxy palaeoecological study of the lateglacial and early Holocene sediments of Jansvatnet, Hammerfest, northernmost Norway (70 degrees 39' N) showed that cold and arid conditions prevailed in both the lateglacial interstadial and the Younger Dryas. Terrestrial proxies are macrofossils and pollen. Aquatic proxies are plant and invertebrate macrofossils, pollen, diatoms, and chironomids. Mean July temperatures were reconstructed using pollen and chironomid calibration functions and ecological knowledge of the fossil flora and fauna. Lake-water pH was reconstructed using a diatom pH-calibration function. Above sterile basal deglacial silts, biotic activity was detected around 14600 years ago in the interstadial (chronologically equivalent to the Bolling-Allerod in the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology). Catchment vegetation resembled polar desert and ultra-cold stenothermic chironomids lived in the lake. However, diatom assemblages were diverse and dynamic. In the Younger Dryas stadial, conditions deteriorated. In the early Younger Dryas chironomid-inferred air temperatures (CI-Tjul) fell about 1 C. Pollen-inferred temperatures (PI-Tjul) did not fall and the terrestrial vegetation hardly changed because of the extreme aridity. The lake water was turbid from suspended clay which diminished aquatic life. Later in the Younger Dryas (ca 12400 cal yr BP) reconstructed mean July temperatures fell by a further 3 degrees C and were close to the minimum to support life, at around 3-4 degrees C. However, decreased turbidity allowed moss growth on the lake bottom that provided habitats for invertebrates and diatoms. In the last 200 years of the Younger Dryas temperatures increased by 2-3 degrees C and terrestrial and aquatic organisms responded quickly. At the start of the Holocene a rapid increase of more than 3 C in PI-Tjul to 9.5 degrees C initiated the replacement of sparse arctic tundra by low-arctic dwarf-shrub heath. Simultaneously, a further 2 degrees C increase in CI-Tjul to 10-11 degrees C reflected a regime shift in the lake. Aquatic macrophytes rapidly replaced the moss carpet, diatom assemblages stabilised and diatom plankton developed, and cold stenotherm chironomids were replaced by cool-temperate taxa. Productivity increased as CI-Tjul reached a steady maximum of around 12 degrees C and PI-Tjul reached 10.5 degrees C at about 10000 cal yr BR At this time, tree-birch arrived and woodland developed over the catchment. Birch could have immigrated from the south up the west coast or from the east along the Barents Sea coast. Acidophilous aquatic taxa increased as diatom-inferred pH gradually decreased from 7.3 to 6.6. After ca 9380 cal yr BP, the density and extent of birch woodland decreased and species of exposed rocky areas increased, reflecting increased windiness, precipitation, and possibly a small decrease in July temperatures. Birch now formed the arctic tree-line at Jansvatnet. The lateglacial climatic pattern at Jansvatnet resembles patterns detected elsewhere in northern Norway and Svalbard and in marine records from the Norwegian and Barents Seas but contrasts with patterns in southern Norway.

The delta C-13 values range from -27.11%. to -21.52%o, a shift of similar to 5.59%, which suggests fluctuating contributions of C-3 and C-4 plants throughout the last 2.5 ka, with C-4 plant input reflecting periods of Maya agriculture. Maya activity in the study area occurred at different intensities from similar to 2600 cal yr BP until similar to 1500 cal yr BP, after which agricultural practices waned as the Maya depopulated the area. These changes in plant assemblages were in response to changes in available water resources, with increased aridity leading to the eventual abandonment of agricultural areas. The Ix Chel archaeological site, located in the study area, is a highland site that would have been among the first agricultural settlements to be affected during periods of aridity. During these periods, minimal water resources would have been available in this highly karstified, well-drained area, and supplemental groundwater extraction would have been difficult due to the extreme depth of the water table.

Assessments are made of the influence of circulation indices (zonal over western Europe and average pressure over central Europe) on regional temperature, precipitation and drought series for northern and central Europe. Changes in the circulation are shown to be very important during the winter in not-them Europe, but only over western and central Europe in summer, Circulation indices in winter, however, only explain up to 25% of surface-climate variability and, except for the British Isles, do not explain any decadal and longer timescale variability in summer. Extreme temperatures and growing-season and frost-season durations and degree-day series are calculated for four sites (Central England, Stockholm, Uppsala and St. Petersburg). Degree-day counts are shown to be very strongly correlated (r > 0.9) to average extended summer ('growing' season, May to September) and extended winter ('frost' season, October to April) temperatures, Durations of the growing and frost seasons are only weakly correlated (r similar to 0.2-0.4) with the appropriate extended seasonal temperatures or degree-day counts. Warmer growing/frost seasons, therefore, need not necessarily be longer/shorter. Counts of extremely warm days in each year are more highly correlated with the growing-season mean temperature than with cold-season temperature. Similarly, counts of extremely cold days in each year are more highly correlated with cold-season temperature than with growing-season temperature. Both the growing-season temperature and the corresponding degree-day counts clearly show warmer temperatures over all series in Fermoscandia before 1860. Over central Europe, and for the Central England temperature series, growing seasons now are of similar warmth to those before 1860. Annually averaged temperatures across the three regions indicate long-term warming which is, however, almost entirely the result of warming during the October to April period.

A quadratic transformation of the tree-ring data accounted for 68% (R-2 adjusted for degrees of freedom lost) when regressed against total summer flow 1931-1985. The distribution of the quadratic reconstruction matched the gauged distribution much better than a simple linear model which only accounted for 62% of the variance. The model was validated by comparing regression estimates against independent data. Years with summer how below the 25th percentile occur nonrandomly, i.e., they tend to cluster, in both the reconstructed and gauged data. Hydrologic regimes have apparently varied considerably in the past on annual to century time-scales, with extended dry and wet periods that exceeded anything in the modern record. The frequency of both wet and dry extremes has varied considerably over the last millennium. The eleventh through thirteenth centuries were not analysed due to reduced replication, but the well-replicated fourteenth and twentieth centuries both have large numbers of extremes. The twentieth century appears to have more extreme low flows than the previous centuries and also to have a large number of high flows. The practical consequences for society of variation in extremes and persistence of low hows may be considerable. Climatic change or anthropogenic changes to the watershed (e.g., widespread upland clearing for agriculture and logging of bottomland forests) may be responsible for the change in hydrologic regime during the twentieth century.

The idea of "preventive conservation" is now the primary focus of cultural preservation worldwide. Risk maps have become the tool to predict cultural heritage vulnerabilities because of irreversible cultural characteristics that can never be duplicated after being destroyed. Because the concepts of risk maps and cultural heritage preservation are relatively new in Taiwan, this study attempts to create a set of cultural heritage risk maps. Using flood as its primary disaster type and New Taipei City in northern Taiwan as its targeted area, this study first analyses disaster-prone areas using current global preservation approaches. Thematic analysis and field study are also used for analysis. Finally, based on cultural heritage vulnerability, the study examines present heritage preservation strategies and rediscovers the three aspects of "sustainable management, disaster management, and climate change and adaptation" in response to cultural heritage management. In addition, this study analyses the feasibility of using parks as water detention areas to reduce flood damage temporarily not only to cultural heritage areas but to human lives and property, as well.

The spatial and temporal variation of dryness/wetness has been assessed by means of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transform analysis were applied to the SPI series computed on both 6-month and 12-month time scales. The results demonstrated noticeable spatial patterns with three sub-regions characterized by different climatic variability: the southeastern downstream part of the basin, the midstream and the western upstream part of the study area. In the upstream and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, an obvious trend towards wetter conditions has been detected from 1990 onward. In addition. inter-decadal changes are obvious, indicating 7-8 years fluctuation in most parts of the region sporadically distributed in the studied period in 95% confidence level. The results of this paper will be helpful for an efficient water resources management under different conditions. Furthermore, three sub-regions should be separately considered in the watershed planning process for mitigating the adverse impacts of future extreme drought or flood occurrences.

All models were set up according to the glacial conditions as specified by the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), although SSTs and sea-ice were supplied from a set of prior coupled model (HadCM3) runs. The simulated climate of New Zealand during the LGM was mainly compared against a control simulation which was set up for pre-industrial conditions. New Zealand's simulated LGM climate was cooler than today, varying spatially between 2.5 and 4 degrees C. There was an increase in seasonality in temperature with the seasonal cooling being largest during winter. Excluding the Alpine/Fiordland region, the largest cooling geographically took place in the east of the South Island (ESI). Annual mean precipitation was reduced but there were significant regional and seasonal variations. The main band of precipitation along the West Coast shifted westwards, resulting in a reduction in precipitation over those regions in the Southern Alps that receive the largest amount of precipitation in today's climate. The westerly circulation increased considerably over the North Island and the northern part of the South Island, but did not change much over the rest of the South Island. The stronger westerly wind accentuated the cooling over the western and northern parts of the North Island and it probably reduced the occurrence of incursions of tropical lows over the north of the North Island. The westerly winds were weaker over New Zealand during winter, which appears to be related to enhanced blocking activity during that season. The number and the strength of the southerlies increased, and they were capable of bringing very cold polar air over most of the country. The east of the South Island was affected especially by these cold winds. The simulated cooling during the LGM is not sufficient to limit forest growth. It is proposed here, that together with the general drier and colder conditions, it was the increase in seasonality and extremes of climate that limited the growth of certain vegetation types.

Chronologic control is based on C-14 and surface-exposure Be-10 dating. After the Lateglacial maximum at 13,000 cal yrs BP, the large ice lobes that filled the eastern reaches of Lago Argentino retreated and separated into individual outlet glaciers; this recession was interrupted only by a stillstand or minor readvance at 12,200 cal yrs BP. The eight largest of these individual outlet glaciers are, from north to south: Upsala, Agassiz, Onelli, Spegazzini, Mayo, Ameghino, Perito Moreno, and Grande (formerly Frias). Holocene recession of Upsala Glacier exposed Brazo Cristina more than 10,115 +/- 100 cal yrs BP, and reached inboard of the Holocene moraines in Agassiz Este Valley by 9205 +/- 85 cal yrs BP; ice remained in an inboard position until 7730 +/- 50 cal yrs BP. Several subsequent glacier readvances are well documented for the Upsala and Frias glaciers. The Upsala Glacier readvanced at least seven times, the first being a relatively minor expansion - documented only in stratigraphic sections - between 7730 +/- 50 and 7210 +/- 45 cal yrs BP. The most extensive Holocene advances of Upsala Glacier resulted in the deposition of the Pearson 1 moraines and related landforms, which are divided into three systems. The Pearson 1a advance occurred about 6000-5000 cal yrs BP and was followed by the slightly less-extensive Pearson 1b and 1c advances dated to 2500-2000 and 1500-1100 cal yrs BP, respectively. Subsequent advances of Upsala Glacier resulted in deposition of the Pearson 2 moraines and corresponding landforms, also separated into three systems, Pearson 2a, 2b, and 2c, constructed respectively at similar to 700, >400, and <300 cal yrs BP to the early 20th century. Similar advances are also recorded by moraine systems in front of Grande Glacier and herein separated into the Frias 1 and Frias 2a, 2b, and 2c. The Onelli and Ameghino glacier valleys also preserve older Holocene moraines. In the Agassiz, Spegazzini, and Mayo valleys, ice of the late-Holocene advances appears to have overridden landforms equivalent in age to Pearson I. Perito Moreno Glacier is an extreme case in which ice of historical (Pearson 2c) advances overrode all older Holocene moraines. Based on the distribution and number of moraines preserved, we infer that the response to climate differed among the Lago Argentino outlet glaciers during the Holocene. This led us to examine the effects of climatic and non-climatic factors on individual glaciers. As a consequence, we detected an important effect of the valley geometry (hypsomety) on the timing and magnitude of glacier response to climate change. These results indicate that caution is needed in correlating moraines among glacier forefields without firm morpho-stratigraphic and age control. Finally, we note important similarities and differences between the overall moraine chronology in the Lago Argentino basin and that in other areas of southern South America and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere.

The goal of this study was to explore the spatial and temporal variations of the de Martonne and Pinna aridity indices over Iran based on temperature and precipitation data from 41 stations for 40 years (1966-2005). The spatially interpolated maps of the aridity indices were prepared using the Ordinary Kriging technique in a GIS environment. The arid and semi-arid regions cover about 88% of Iran according to the de Martonne index, while about 96% of the country's areas are classified as dry and semi-dry based on the Pinna index. A strong relationship was found between the values of the de Martonne and Pinna indices, confirming their similar spatial distribution. Around 63% of the two indices series had a decreasing tendency. The significant decreasing trends of the aridity indices were observed mainly in the western and northwestern regions of the country. The relative changes of the aridity indices at the stations with significant decreasing trends were in the range of 18%-54%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Evaluating the return period and amplitude of modern climatic extremes in light of pre-industrial natural changes is, however, limited by generally too short instrumental meteorological observations. Here we introduce and analyze 11,873 annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurement series from living and historical fir (Abies alba Mill.) trees sampled across France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Czech Republic, which continuously span the AD 962-2007 period. Even though a dominant climatic driver of European fir growth was not found, ring width extremes were evidently triggered by anomalous variations in Central European April June precipitation. Wet conditions were associated with dynamic low-pressure cells, whereas continental-scale droughts coincided with persistent high-pressure between 35 and 55 degrees N. Documentary evidence independently confirms many of the dendro signals over the past millennium, and further provides insight on causes and consequences of ambient weather conditions related to the reconstructed extremes. A fairly uniform distribution of hydroclimatic extremes throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age and Recent Global Warming may question the common believe that frequency and severity of such events closely relates to climate mean stages. This joint dendro-documentary approach not only allows extreme climate conditions of the industrial era to be placed against the backdrop of natural variations, but also probably helps to constrain climate model simulations over exceptional long timescales.

Annual precipitation in the Yellowstone National Park region since AD 1173	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						drought; paleoclimate; tree rings; decadal to multidecadal variability; Greater Yellowstone Region; Rocky Mountains	WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; UNITED-STATES; DROUGHT VARIABILITY; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; TIME-SERIES; PACIFIC; OSCILLATION; DISTURBANCE; PATTERNS; ASPEN	Cores and cross sections from 133 limber pine (Pinusflexilis James) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) at four sites were used to estimate annual (July to June) precipitation in the Yellowstone National Park region for the period from AD 1173 to 1998. Examination of the long-term record shows that the early 20th century was markedly wet compared to the previous 700 yr. Extreme wet and dry years within the instrumental period fall within the range of past variability, and the magnitude of the worst-case droughts of the 20th century (AD 1930s and 1950s) was likely equaled or exceeded on numerous occasions before AD 1900. Spectral analysis showed significant decadal to multidecadal precipitation variability. At times this lower frequency variability produces strong regime-like behavior in regional precipitation, with the potential for rapid, high-amplitude switching between predominately wet and predominately dry conditions. Over multiple time scales, strong Yellowstone region precipitation anomalies were almost always associated with spatially extensive events spanning various combinations of the central and southern U.S. Rockies, the northern U.S.-Southern Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.

It is based on the analysed records of storm events along Western Brittany coast (see Part I). In this manuscript (Part II), storm recurrence is explored along with forcing mechanisms. Periods of more frequent storm events over the two last centuries are analysed first in order to link these events with possible forcing mechanisms (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) modes) triggering the most destructive storms. Then, palaeostorm events are discussed at the Holocene scale, from 6000 yr BP to present, to verify the forcing mechanisms. Most recorded events appear to be linked with cooling episodes, mostly in winter, a transition to or from a negative winter NAO mode, a positive AMO mode. Extreme storms occur immediately prior to the 'Medieval Warm Period' (MWP). Maximum effects are reached prior to the onset of the MWP and during the Maunder and Dalton solar minima. Low storm activity occurred during the Sporer Minimum linked to an acceleration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Main storm triggers seem to correspond to a positive AMO mode with an unstable jetstream configuration driving a negative NAO. In this study, four specific weather configurations were defined to explain each type of recorded storminess. The strongest storms correspond to low AMO and decennial-negative NAO modes (e. g. 'Little Ice Age'), or high AMO in association with dominant low NAO modes, as during the early Middle Age and present-day period. Fresh or warm oceans in association with a positive NAO mode are stormy but with very low sting storms frequency. Although in agreement with the orbital forcing and the Holocene glacial history, increasing storm frequency and intensity is most probably partly biased by continuous sea-level rise and resulting erosion.

Here we report an alkenone-based temperature reconstruction for growing season over the past 1600 years from the varved sediment in Lake Sihailongwan, northeastern China. The most notable cold spells occurred during the periods AD 480-860, AD 1260-1300, AD 1510-1570 and AD 1800-1900 with a temperature decrease of about 1 degrees C compared with the 20th century. Based on the historical evidence such as 'snow or frost in the summertime' and 'no ice during the wintertime', we compile extreme cold summer events and warm winter events over the past 1600 years. The 'Little Ice Age' time period experienced more extreme cold summer/warm winter events, while the 'Medieval Warm Period' had milder winters. Comparatively, the natural proxy data show a general similar pattern with historical documents at decadal time scales, except for between ad 1620 and 1720. Our results show multidecadal to centennial variations in seasonal temperature, possibly caused by interactions of external natural forcing and atmosphere-ocean circulations.

Latitudinal variation in a photoperiod response gene in European barley: insight into the dynamics of agricultural spread from 'historic' specimens	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Barley; Hordeum vulgare; Herbarium; Photoperiod response; 'Historic' DNA; Agricultural spread	HORDEUM-VULGARE L.; FLOWERING TIME; ANCIENT-DNA; ADAPTATION	Between ca. 6000 BC and ca. 500 BC, barley cultivation spread across the continent of Europe from the extreme south to the extreme north. Carbon-dating would suggest that this spread, and indeed the spread of crop cultivation generally, varied in its pace, with 'delays' at certain points along its route. Such delays in the spread of agriculture have been explained as resulting from the slow assimilation of agricultural practices by existing indigenous human populations or as the time taken for the crops to adapt to novel climatic conditions, such as altered temperature regimes and day-lengths. A mutant form of the photoperiod response gene, Ppd-H1, causes barley to be non-responsive to long days, while the wild-type responsive form allows plants to flower in response to long days. We sequenced this gene in 65 'historic' barley accessions, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in order to explore the potential role of environmental adaptation in the spread of agriculture. We chose to use 'historic' material, to complement the richer patterns in extant genetic lines, by spreading the data range in both time and space. Our 'historic' barley data shows a latitudinal divide in the Ppd-H1 gene similar to that found in extant lines, but with clearer geographical resolution, and extending northwards into the Arctic Circle. We discuss the implications of our results in relation to the dynamics of agricultural spread across Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of strontium isotopes as an indicator of migration in human and pig Lapita populations in the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New Guinea	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Lapita cultural complex; Migration; Anir islands; Bismarck Archipelago; Strontium isotopes; Pigs (Sus scrofa)	COOK-AUSTRAL ISLANDS; PREHISTORIC MIGRATION; TOOTH ENAMEL; SR; RATIOS; OXYGEN; ROCKS; BONE; AGE; ND	This paper examines the potential use of strontium isotopes ((87)Sr/(86)Sr) for identifying migration within Lapita populations and their commensal animals, specifically the pig (Sus scrofa). Lapita people (ca. 3300-2200 BP) were the initial colonists of the island groups to the east of the Solomon Islands, spreading from Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa within a few centuries. Mobility is assumed to have been an important mechanism for maintaining cultural solidarity between Lapita communities. It has been previously argued that Lapita populations became progressively more sedentary over time after the initial colonising events. Two Lapita sites, Kamgot and Balbalankin, from the Anir Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago are included in the analysis and fall within the Early (ca. 3300-3000/2900 BP) and Middle (ca. 3000/2900-2700 BP) Lapita periods respectively. Ten tooth enamel samples from Lapita human and pig teeth as well as modern teeth were analysed for strontium isotopes. The mean values for the individuals from both sites were higher than the geological value obtained for the Anir islands reflecting the incorporation of marine-derived strontium into their tooth enamel taken up in their diet. Although the sample sites have similar environments there was a difference between the local ranges of the strontium isotopic data. One Lapita age pig and one potentially modern pig from Kamgot fell well outside the local distribution for the site and were considered to be non-local. The extreme distribution of the two outliers suggests they came from two geographically separate locations. The results from the Anir Islands when compared with strontium results from other prehistoric Pacific Island populations suggest there is sufficient variation between island groups in terms of the biologically available strontium to justify further research. The present results are discussed in terms of using pigs as a proxy for human mobility as well as an indicator for the 'local' range of an archaeological population by treating human and pigs as separate populations. Strontium isotopes therefore provide the opportunity to investigate migration in Lapita populations on a finer scale than was previously possible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Schaefer site in extreme southeastern Wisconsin, USA was excavated in 1992 and 1993. Seventy-five percent of a mammoth ?Mammuthus primigenius, the woolly mammoth (but comparable as well with M. jeffersonii, the Jefferson mammoth) was recovered. Drifted wood specimens and plant macro fossils were also recovered from the site. Twenty-five specimens of wood have been identified as Picea sp., Picea/Larix sp., or unidentified hardwood. Macro fossils in the form of cones have been identified as black spruce (Picea mariana). These preliminary data do not appear to support the traditional environment inferred for the woolly mammoth and points to a need for study of the animal's attribution to species. The animal was a male, 36 years of age at death. Thirteen AMS 14C assays on bone cluster between 12,290 and 12,570 BP. Sixteen dates on wood specimens intimately associated with bone yield a range of dates from 11,980 to 12,940 BP. The remains exhibit multiple cut and wedge marks interpreted as cultural. Non-diagnostic cultural lithics were recovered. A disarticulated bone pile deposited in a low energy environment is consistent with human interaction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Originally excavated in the 1950s as a palaeontological site, it was re-opened in the 1990s and stone tools were found associated with the fauna, suggesting that it is also an archaeological occurrence. Excavations in the 1950s and 1990s uncovered thousands of bones of an early Galerian fauna, including the remains of new species of Hippopotamus, Equus, and Canis (Vekua, 1962, 1987) and dominated by the remains of Equus sussenbornensis. We present the stratigraphy of the site, which together with faunal correlations and reversed paleomagnetics indicates an age most likely in the late Matuyama Chron, probably between 980,000 and 780,000 years ago. Taphonomic analysis suggests that the fauna was deposited and buried over a short time period, and was heavily modified by carnivores, but we cannot demonstrate involvement by hominins. Based on evidence of abundant krotovina (animal burrows filled with sediment) and the lack of definitive evidence for hominin modification to the bones, the stone tools at the site may have been mixed in with the older fauna. The taphonomic characteristics of the Akhalkalaki bone assemblage are not readily explained with reference to assemblage formation processes developed with actualistic studies that have been mostly conducted in Africa, including carnivore dens, predator arenas, human hunting and scavenging, mass deaths, or attritional bone deposition. Because of extreme anthropogenic modification fo the present environments, the temperate setting, and the presence of mainly extinct taxa, local models based on actualistic studies cannot approximate the mammalian ecology reflected in the Akhalkalaki bone assemblage. A few comparisons are made with preliminary taphonomic observations from Dmanisi, and Early Pleistocene Homo ergaster site not far away.

Water temperatures, inferred from oxygen isotopes in the shells, were about 1 degrees C cooler than present and stable between 2000 and 700 yr ago. Between about 700 and 500 yr ago, seasonal variation was greater than present, with extremes above and below historic levels. Water temperatures were 2-3 degrees C cooler than today 500-300 yr ago. The interval of variable sea temperatures 700-500 yr ago partially coincided with an interval of drought throughout central California. A coincident disruption in human settlement along the coast suggests movements of people related to declining water sources. Quantities of fish bone in central coast middens dating to this same period are high relative to other periods, and the remains of northern anchovies, a species sensitive to changing oceanographic conditions, are also abundant. The continued use of local fisheries suggests that changes in settlement and diet were influenced more by drought than by a decrease in marine productivity, as fish provided a staple during an interval of low terrestrial productivity.

In this study, driving forces of lake-level changes at Laguna Potrok Aike are evaluated by means of process studies using data from an extensive multi-year monitoring in and around the lake. Lake-volume changes were calculated with an energy-budget/bulk-transfer approach and translated into lake-level variations, which were then compared to pressure sensor data. Calculated lake levels are in broad agreement with measured data. We hypothesize that on short time scales, lake-level fluctuations are mainly driven by the precipitation-to-evaporation ratio. Apart from changing catchment conditions, relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, wind strength and wind direction have the most important influence on the hydrological balance of the lake. Lake level decreases during periods of persistently high wind speeds from westerly directions, whereas, during periods with more frequent occurrences of easterly winds, it increases. These situations are linked to a strengthening of the Southern Hemispheric Westerlies in the first and more frequent blocking situations in the latter case. Although lake-level changes at Laguna Potrok Aike show some degree of similarity to variations of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM), a persistent correspondence remains to be documented. Water chemistry and sediment-trap data suggest that lake-internal carbonate precipitation is highly sensitive to short-term changes in the lake water volume and, thus, to lake-level variations. However, it becomes obvious that the sedimentary carbonate record, representing changes on longer time scales, is not linearly linked to lake-level changes, hence complicating quantitative lake-level reconstructions back in time. We suggest that short-term changes in authigenic carbonate production are mainly driven by changing precipitation/evaporation ratios probably superimposed on longer-term changes in groundwater input that represent a buffered climate signal. Scenario calculations for a period of 60 years show that changes of the controlling meteorological parameters in the range of 15-17% can lead to lake-level changes with a magnitude comparable to the reconstructed Holocene and Lateglacial extreme situations. In addition, modifications in the water-retaining capacity of the lake can also produce large lake-level changes. It is hypothesized that the development or disappearance of permafrost in the catchment of Laguna Potrok Aike during the Last Glacial/Interglacial transition may have changed the water-retaining capacity tremendously. The lake-level reconstructions for Laguna Potrok Aike might express some of the meridional climate variability observed in coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulations for southern South America for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid Holocene.

Tracking changes in bone fracture morphology over time: environment, taphonomy, and the archaeological record	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Taphonomy; Bone fracture morphology; Frozen bone; Bone degradation; Environmental archaeology; Experimental archaeology; Zooarchaeology	HAMMERSTONE PERCUSSION; LONG BONES; ASSEMBLAGES; PATTERNS; NOTCHES; MARKS	Zooarchaeologists have often employed studies of bone fracture morphology as a means of understanding past human cultural activity, and various methodological approaches have been developed for analyzing archaeological broken bone assemblages. It is widely understood that bones degrade over time, however, few studies have attempted to define and quantify the rate at which bones degrade and fracture morphologies change. This study examines degradation in frozen bones (-20 degrees C) and bones exposed to hot (40 degrees C) dry conditions. These two simulated environmental conditions represent extreme real-world climates, and allow for an actualistic understanding of the rates of degradation that bones experience in nature. When frozen, bones degrade slowly but significantly, and demonstrate measurable differences in samples frozen for 1, 10, 20, 40, and 60 weeks. In hot, dry conditions, bones degrade very quickly, and demonstrate measurable differences after 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. These data allow for a more detailed understanding of the relationship between the cultural and natural processes that result in bone fracture, and the time period during which bones can be expected to maintain fresh fracture characteristics. This research also has implications for understanding human subsistence and survival strategies and for interpreting the archaeological record. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two sets of multi-decadal simulations at 20-km grid spacing for present day (1961-1990) and future climate (2071-2100, A2 scenario) are conducted. The results of the control experiment from 1961 to 1990 indicate that both the simulated annual averaged temperature and precipitation in the Yangtze River basin have distinct topographic characters and agree with the observations since the detailed topography of Yangtze River basin is incorporated into the high resolution of RegCM3. The simulated temperature of the Yangtze River basin is quite consistent with the observed one. It can reproduce more detailed structures of surface temperature distribution in annual, winter and summer average, which decreases from southeast to northwest and the cold bias is less of 1-2 degrees C. The simulated annual precipitation is less than the observation, while the result is better in summer than in winter although it may overestimate rainfall induced by topographic forcing at the Tibetan Plateau margin. Then the RegCM3 and a large-scale routing model (LRM) are linked to project the future climate change effects on hydrological processes over the Yangtze River basin. The results show that on average the evapotranspiration augments with a significant increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, while the spatial distribution is greatly inhomogeneous over the whole basin. The streamflow will also decrease especially in flood season from May to September which may aggravate the crisis of water resources shortage over the basin in flood season. The temperature increase will also lead to the augmentation in snow melt runoff, which may arise more often and earlier than spring runoff, and finally will provoke more changes in the seasonal rainfall-runoff processes and the allocation of the intra-annual water resources. The flood disaster should decrease in the main stream of the Yangtze River which may increase in the Hanjiang River basin. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Decreased production at obsidian sources, dramatic increases in bead production, trade, and sociopolitical complexity in the Channel Islands, and subsistence changes on the central coast were among the trends attributed to drought-related demographic stress by researchers in the 1990s. Review of more recent archaeological research shows that as the search for signs of unusual cultural changes during the MCA has broadened, some of these early patterns (e.g. violence and health problems) have been found to be more complicated and regionally varied than previously thought while others (e.g., settlement disruption, deterioration of long distance trade, and population movements) have been further corroborated.

As part of the INTAS-funded CLIMAN project into Holocene climatic variability and the evolution of human settlement in the Aral Sea basin, fossil diatom assemblages contained within a sediment core obtained from the Aral Sea have been applied to a diatom-based inference model of conductivity (r(2) = 0.767, RMSEP = 0.469 log(10) mu S cm(-1)). This has provided a high-resolution record of conductivity and lake level change over the last ca. 1600 yr. Three severe episodes of lake level regression are indicated at ca. AD 400, AD 11951355 and ca. AD 178) to the present day. The first two regressions may be linked to the natural diversion of the Amu Darya away from the Aral Sea and the failure of cyclones formed in the Mediterranean to penetrate more continental regions. Human activity, however, and in particular the destruction of irrigation facilities are synchronous with these early regressions and contributed to the severity of the observed low stands.

When the lake ice melts during late spring, the debris sinks to the lake bottom. A flux record of the number of minerogenic particles > 1 mm per unit time, obtained by combining two sediment cores from the lake, shows a significant increase in snow-avalanche activity after similar to 2000 cal. BR Prior to that, periods with enhanced snow-avalanche activity around the lake occurred - 8500-8300, 8200-7900, 7300-6300, 5900-5400, 5000-4600, 3700-3400, 3100-2800, 2700-2600 and 2500-2300 cal. BP. The snow-avalanche record from western Norway has been compared with a record of Holocene snow-avalanche activity in the More area in western Norway, a record of Holocene river floods in eastern Norway, and Holocene debris-flow events in southern Norway. Knowledge of the past magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events, such as snow avalanches, may help making climate model simulations and scenarios of extreme weather events more reliable.

Sandy layers in the loess deposits, the "Upper sand" and "Lower sand" (layers L9 and L15, respectively), which represent a high-resolution record of paleomonsoon changes, have been sampled at intervals of 5-6 cm from sections at Luochuan and Xifeng, The grain size and magnetic susceptibility was measured for all samples, The grain-size results (a proxy of winter monsoon strength) indicate that the winter monsoon strength fluctuated on a millennial timescale during cold climatic extremes, with climatic events of a few hundred to a few thousand years. However, the winter monsoon was relatively stable during warm periods. The magnetic susceptibility signal (a proxy of summer monsoon intensity) is practically constant over the same period. This is tentatively explained by the assumption that the summer monsoon intensity was too low to be recorded in the magnetic susceptibility signal. The intensified winter monsoon events show periodicities in a range of 1000 to 2770 yr, with a dominant cycle of approximately 1450 yr, The detection of this oscillation in older glacial stages strongly suggests that it may be a pervasive cycle of the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary, Millennial-scale variations of the winter monsoon may be caused by instability of the westerly jet, which is determined by temperature differences between the polar and the equatorial regions.

The first three principal components together explain 78.21% of the total variance. The first principal component (PC1) accounts for 51.58% of the total variance, and represents consistent tree-growth variations in the northeastern TP. The second EOF mode reveals an opposite structure for the southern and northern parts of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, reflecting the effect of huge topography and associated atmospheric circulation on tree-growth anomalies. The third EOF mode represents an opposite structure for the eastern and western parts of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, possibly indicating the influence of different branches of atmospheric circulation system in this area. The EOF analysis results of instrumental precipitation data resemble those derived from the seven regional chronologies, providing further support that tree growth is a good indicator of regional precipitation variations. According to the PC1, dry conditions occurred in ad 1450-1510, 1631-1739, 1765-1833, 1866-1883 and 1921-1947, whereas periods of relatively wet years are identified for ad 1511-1630, 1740-1764, 1834-1865, 1884-1920 and 1948-2001. During the past 550 years, 28 years with extreme regional growth depressions was identified. These ring-width extremes generally occurred in century-scale dry periods. The years 1467, 1484, 1641, 1721, and 1928 with extreme tree-growth reductions in the northeastern TP are coeval with severe drought events in eastern China. In addition, the dry intervals or extreme growth depressions generally coincided with cold periods in the northeastern TP and vice versa, implying that the probability of occurrence of wet events in the northeastern TP will be higher in the future under the ongoing global warming.

Associations among modern pollen, vegetation, and climate in western North America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							SPACE-TIME CLIMATE; MODERN ANALOGS; UNITED-STATES; SOURCE AREA; SURFACE; USA; SPECTRA; VARIABILITY; WASHINGTON; EUROPE	A compilation of 1884 modern pollen surface samples was analyzed to explore the relationships between spatial distributions of pollen percentage data vs. climate and vegetation in western North America. Modern pollen spectra capture many of the unique traits of regional vegetation patterns and reflect regional patterns of climate diversity. Large-scale vegetation differences were identifiable by their pollen signatures. At the coarsest scale, forested regions were dominated by arboreal pollen and Pinus pollen abundances were typically >30%. In contrast, non-forested regions were dominated by shrub and herbaceous pollen types with Pinus percentages typically <30%. At finer scales, indicator taxa were useful for identifying vegetation types. For example, Picea was a good first-order indicator of boreal spruce forest vegetation with relatively high median percentages (22%), whereas Quercus was a good first-order indicator of desert vegetation with low median percentages (1%). Pollen abundance also provided climatic information. High Betula percentages occurred over a relatively narrow climatic range corresponding with their high latitudinal distribution, high Artemisia percentages were registered in winter-cold and dry climates of the interior basins. Arboreal pollen types were abundant in cool and wet climates, while non-arboreal pollen types dominate in climates that are warm and dry. Using pollen assemblages to predict local climate conditions shows that climate conditions are well predicted given knowledge of pollen spectra and climate conditions of the nearest analogues. Low accuracy was evident with pollen-based climate predictions in desert regions and temperate rainforests because of either poor sample density (in the case of the former) or extremes in temperature and/or precipitation (in the case of both). In other regions, vegetation and climate space were accurately predicted even when proximal samples, within 100 km, are excluded as the possible analogues. These results show that, within the vegetation and climate space of this region, the modern-analogue technique is useful for quantifying broad-scale vegetation and climate changes.

The geographical focus of the paper includes Anatolia and the Levant, two major regions of the Eastern Roman Empire that are rich in environmental, historical and archaeological data. The paper starts with the review of current research on the economic, settlement and vegetation history of the Eastern Mediterranean in Late Antiquity, which provides the necessary framework for the study of potential climate impacts. The core of the article is devoted to the analysis of the palaeoclimatic evidence, which is divided in two groups. The first one encompasses the direct evidence, that is palaeoclimate proxies and the textual record of extreme weather events, while the second includes indirect information on climate, in particular multi-proxy studies that include pollen analysis, archaeological evidence, and the historical evidence of subsistence crises. We conclude that during our study period there occurred three periods of substantially different climatic conditions. A late Roman drought similar to 350-470 AD was followed by a dramatic shift to much wetter climatic conditions. These in turn changed into increasing dryness after similar to 730 AD in Anatolia and similar to 670 AD in the Levant. The lack of chronological precision in the dating of the archaeological evidence and of some climatic records makes it impossible at present to make conclusive observations regarding the societal responses to these climatic fluctuations. Nonetheless in all probability, the extended and - in some areas - severe late Roman drought did not cause any major social upheaval or economic decline in Anatolia or the Levant, although it appears to have contributed to a change in patterns of water use in the cities. In contrast, the increased availability of moisture after -470 AD does appear to have contributed to the expansion of rural settlement and agriculture into environmentally marginal terrain, including semi-arid areas such as the Negev. In this way climate probably contributed to the general economic prosperity of the late Roman Empire in the east of the Mediterranean basin. The end of this late Roman world system came about finally in mid-7th c. and, at least in Anatolia, is not directly associated with any shift in climatic conditions. Aridity during early Medieval times may be one of the main factors behind the gradual long-term decline of settlement on the marginal lands in the Levant following Islamic conquest.

Timing of occupation and regional settlement patterns revealed by time-series analyses of an archaeological radiocarbon database for the South-Central Andes (16 degrees-25 degrees S)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Summed probabilities; Central Andes; Atacama Desert; Palaeodemography; Time-series	TEMPORAL FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; ATACAMA DESERT; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; NEOLITHIC TRANSITION; POPULATION HISTORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DATES; CHRONOLOGY; DEMOGRAPHY; IMPACT	Developing spatially resolved high-resolution datasets of robust long-term changes in human demography constitutes a major challenge for archaeology. One approach is to use the distribution of summed radiocarbon-age probabilities to infer long-term population dynamics (i.e. palaeodemography). However, these can often be biased by preservation potential, site taphonomy or researcher priorities among other aspects, all of which require large datasets to resolve adequately. For this report, we have created such a dataset for the South-Central Andes (16 degrees-25 degrees S), here termed the South Central Andes Radiocarbon (SCAR) database. SCAR spans the last 15,000 years and incorporates similar to 1700 C-14-dates from 519 archeological sites reported across an extreme bioclimatic gradient that includes the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert and adjacent cold, high-elevation Altiplano. Among the possible methodological biases, we first evaluated those related to calibration procedures. Otherwise, changes in summed probability curves show no other relevant biases except for possible research interest/priorities that could be responsible for the gaps in the record from the Bolivian altiplano. Our temporally continuous time-series indicates that prehispanic populations exhibited significant demographic changes during the last 13,100 cal BP. Except for coastal populations; most regions show strongly coordinated demographic fluctuations that follow the same major patterns. Thus, we identified two broad scale population events across the South-Central Andes (Atacama inland, Bolivian Altiplano) from 13,100-4000 cal BP and then from 4000 cal BP to the present. In contrast, the Atacama coastal records suggest a different and more variable occupation pattern over the last 13,460 cal BP, which could be driven by the interaction with oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling). A widespread major decline at 700 cal BP clearly predates the Spanish colonization and occurs in all of our regions. This widespread decline does not appear to be due to methodological biases, and suggests that a population crash occurred before European occupation. Overall, the SCAR database constitutes a valuable proxy for establishing the long-term dynamics of prehistoric societies that inhabited the western Andean slope. Time-series analyses that use SCAR will shed new light on the demographic and cultural dynamics at different spatial-scales, and help clarify the processes involved in the migrational trajectories and cultural evolution of the peoples that inhabited the South-Central Andes over the last 15,000 years.

Time-slice maps of planktonic foraminiferal derived summer sea surface temperature (SST) and export productivity (Pexp) were established for specific time intervals within the last 35 ky: the Holocene (Recent and last 8 ky), Younger Dryas (YD), Heinrich Stadials (HS) 1, 2a, 2b, 3, and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The SST during the Holocene shows the same latitudinal gradient along the western Iberian margin as present-day with cold but productive areas that reflect the influence of coastal up-welling centers. The LGM appears as a slightly less warm, but more productive period relative to the Holocene and present-day conditions, suggesting that sea-level minima forced a westward displacement of the coastal upwelling centers possibly accompanied by a strengthening of northward winds. During the YD, a longitudinal thermal front is depicted at 10 degrees W, with cold polar waters offshore and warmer subtropical waters inshore, suggesting that the subtropical Paleo-Iberian Poleward Current more likely flowed at a more inshore location masking the local SST signal and amplitude of variation. A substantial cooling and drop in productivity is observed during all HS, in particular HS1 and HS3, reflecting the penetration of icebergs-derived meltwater. These most extreme southward extensions of very cold waters define a strong SST gradient that marks a possible Paleo-Azores Front. Higher production south of this front was likely fed by frontal nutrient advection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Salgueiro, E.; Naughton, F.; Voelker, A. H.

Ten indices of extreme precipitation were studied. Maximum 1-day precipitation, very wet day precipitation, extremely wet day precipitation, simple daily intensity index, and consecutive dry days in the study area during 1960-2011 exhibit non-significant increasing trends. Decreasing trends are found for maximum 5-day precipitation, wet day precipitation, number of heavy precipitation days, number of very heavy precipitation days, and consecutive wet days, all statistically non-significant. For number of heavy precipitation days and consecutive wet days, stations in the study region have consistently negative trends. The variation trends for the other extreme precipitation indices have regional differences, and the change patterns of these indices are not spatially clustered. Very wet day precipitation experiences abrupt decreases in 1977 and 1985, while a significant abrupt increase change for extremely wet day precipitation is detected in 1983. There are multiple cycles in the changes for the very wet day precipitation and extremely wet day precipitation over Shaanxi Province during 1960-2011, showing variations of time and frequency. Except for consecutive dry days, the other extreme precipitation indices have high correlations with annual total precipitation. The elevation is positively correlated with consecutive dry days. There are negative correlations between the other extreme precipitation indices and elevation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Holocene glacier fluctuations and climate changes in the southeastern part of the Russian Altai (South Siberia) based on a radiocarbon chronology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Holocene glaciations; Glacier fluctuations; Climatic variations; Upper tree limit; Radiocarbon dating; Russian Altai	LATEST PLEISTOCENE; SOFIYSKIY GLACIER; AGE CALIBRATION; MOUNTAINS; DYNAMICS; HISTORY; NORWAY; SHAN	This study investigates glacier dynamic and climatic variations in the southeastern part of the Russian Altai (SE Altai) during the last 7000 years. Recent glacier retreats and ice melting in moraines has led to exhumation of organic material allowing the possibility of radiocarbon dating. We report here 57 new radiocarbon dates from wood remains buried by moraines and from proglacial forefields, from peat layers and lacustrine sediments that cover moraines, from dead trees at the upper tree limit, and from rock glaciers on trough slopes from six glacial valleys in the North Chuya Range, SE Altai. Such a numerous dataset for the vast but unified in neotectonic and climatic conditions area is presented for the first time the history of research in the Altai. Together with 62 previously published radiocarbon ages, mainly of fossil soils and peat layers in the foot of the ranges in SE Altai, they form the basis for understanding the relative magnitudes and timing of the most important glacial and climatic events of SE Altai. New data refute the traditional concept of the Russian Altai Holocene glaciations as a consecutive retreat of the late Wurm glaciers and argue their complete degradation at the head of trough valleys at least 7000 cal. years BR Moraine complexes of three Holocene glacial stages are morphologically expressed in trough valleys of the North Chuya range. They correlate with three identified periods of glacial advances: from 4900 to 4200 cal. years BP (Akkem stage), from 2300 to 1700 cal. years BP (Historical stage) and in the 13th-19th centuries (Little Ice Age (LIA) or Aktru stage). The coincident extremes of lowering temperature and increasing precipitation during the Akkem stage led to abrupt glacier advances and forming of the most remote moraine complexes downstream in the valleys. Following glacier advances had distinctly smaller magnitudes. In addition to the radiocarbon data, the time limits of the Historical stage were defined more precisely using dendrochronological and archaeological data from Scythian burials of Pazyryk culture in SE Altai. Repeated forest regrowth in the presently glaciatiated area indicates significant retreat or even complete glacier degradation during interstage warming. The decreases of glacier length in the following stages argues for intensification of aridity in the SE Altai during the second half of the Holocene. The thermal minimum in the middle of 19th century, the greatest in the last millennium, did not positively influence the mass balance of glaciers, which also supports this conclusion.

Washburn was to reconstruct mean annual air temperature using periglacial features as climate indicators. This paper reviews existing periglacial indicators and proposes a strategy to improve their thermal resolution based on recent periglacial process studies, with a focus on solifluction and thermal contraction cracking and associated landforms/structures. Landforms resulting from solifluction reflect both the depth subjected to freeze-thaw and the thickness of frost-susceptible soils. The thickness of a solifluction structure can be used to infer the dominant freeze-thaw regime and minimum seasonal frost depth. Ice-wedge pseudomorphs have limited potential as a climate indicator because (1) they mainly reflect extreme winter temperatures, (2) their thermal thresholds depend on the host material, and (3) they need to be distinguished from frost wedges of other origin produced under different thermal and/or material conditions. Monitoring studies of currently active ice wedges suggest that ice-wedge cracking requires a combination of low temperature and large temperature gradients in the frozen active layer. Further field monitoring of periglacial processes and their controlling factors under various climate conditions and in various materials are needed, however, to improve the resolution of periglacial paleoclimate indicators.

Numerous tree-ring chronologies have also been built in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily for dendroclimatology, but multimillennial chronologies are rare. Development of long chronologies from the Southern Hemisphere is therefore important to provide a long-term perspective on environmental change at local, regional and global scales. This paper describes the extension of the New Zealand Agathis australis (kauri) chronology from AD 911 to 1724 BC. Subfossil (swamp) kauri was collected from 17 swamp sites in the upper North Island. Kauri timbers were also obtained from an early twentieth century house on the University of Auckland campus. Twelve site chronologies and I I independent tree-sequences were constructed and crossmatched to produce a 3631-yr record, which was calendar dated to 1724 BC-AD 1907 against the modern kauri master chronology. A new long chronology, AGAUc04a, was built by combining the modern kauri data with house timbers and subfossil kauri. This new chronology spans 1724 BC-AD 1998. It is of similar length to chronologies from Tasmania and South America and is the longest tree-ring chronology yet built in New Zealand. The greatest significance of the long kauri chronology lies in its potential as a high-quality palaeoclimate proxy, especially with regard to investigation of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The chronology also has application to investigation of extreme environmental events, dendroecology, archaeology and radiocarbon calibration.

Erosion rates in an active orogen (NE-Taiwan): A confrontation of cosmogenic measurements with river suspended loads	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY			English	Article						Denudation rates; Erosion rates; In situ-produced cosmogenic Be-10; Taiwan	SITU-PRODUCED BE-10; MOUNTAIN BELT; TOPOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; DENUDATION RATES; STEADY-STATE; HALF-LIFE; NUCLIDES; CLIMATE; SURFACES	The direct and feedback relationships between tectonics, climate and denudation are a matter of debate. A better understanding of these relationships requires quantifying rates of denudation in a wide range of climate and tectonic settings, as well as at various time and space scales. Because of an ongoing active collision implying high uplift rates and a climate prone to extreme rainfall events and frequent tropical typhoons facilitating strong erosion dominated by mass movements and high degree of fluvial transport, the Taiwan environment is highly dynamic. In this work, spatially-averaged denudation rates determined along the network of one of the major rivers in Taiwan (Lanyang River) from in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides (Be-10) measured in river-borne quartz minerals are compared to the erosion rates determined from the statistical analysis of modem sediment load data. Integrated over the last several hundreds of years, the denudation rate derived from in situ-produced Be-10 concentrations averages 2 +/- 1 mm/yr within the Lanyang watershed. Integrated over the last 50 years, the erosion rate given by modern sediment load data is 5-7 mm/yr within the same catchment area. The studied catchment being characterized by a relatively low-level of human activity, the discrepancy between the two rates is most probably due different sensibilities to high-frequency, stochastic erosional events;typhoons and earthquakes). The cosmogenic-derived denudation rates can thus be regarded as more representatives for quantifying erosion processes on the short-time scale, and be strictly compared to the long-term exhumation rates derived from low-temperature chronological data.

Results reveal millennial-scale climate variability over the last deglaciation, in particular during the LGIT. In the Iberian margin, Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the Younger Dryas (YD) represent two extreme episodes of cold sea surface condition separated by a marine warm phase that coincides with the Bolling-Allered interval (B-A) on the neighboring continent. Following the YD event, an abrupt sea surface warming marks the beginning of the Holocene in this region. SSTs recorded in core D13882 changed, however, faster than those at deep-sea site MD03-2699 and at the other available palaeoclimate sequences from the region. While the SST values from most deep-sea cores reflect the latitudinal gradient detected in the Iberian Peninsula atmospheric temperature proxies during H1 and the B-A, the Tagus mud patch (core D13882) experienced colder SSTs during both events. This is most certainly related to a supplementary input of cold freshwater from the continent to the Tagus mud patch, a hypothesis supported by the high contents of terrigenous biomarkers and total organic carbon as well as by the dominance of tetra-unsaturated alkenone (C-37:4) observed at this site. The comparison of all western Iberia SST records suggests that the SST increase that characterizes the B-A event in this region started 1000 yr before meltwater pulse 1A (mwp-1A) and reached its maximum values during or slightly after this episode of substantial sea-level rise. In contrast, during the YD/Holocene transition, the sharp SST rise in the Tagus mud patch is synchronous with meltwater pulse 1B. The decrease of continental input to the mud patch confirms a sea level rise in the region. Thus, the synchronism between the maximum warming in the mid-latitudes off the western Iberian margin, the adjacent landmasses and Greenland indicates that mwp-1B and the associated sea-level rise probably initiated in the Northern Hemisphere rather than in the South.

Major changes in the composition of the cyst association, cyst concentration and morphology of Operculodinium centrocatpum reflect changes in sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), palaeoproductivity and upwelling intensity. These changes can be associated with latitudinal shifts of the circumpolar frontal systems. The high cyst concentration, high Brigantedinium spp abundances, low species diversity and the occurrence of certain cold water species are supportive for a 7-10 degrees equatorward shift of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) during the coldest phase of the List Glacial Maximum (LGM) between 25 and 211 cal ka BP Deglacial warming initiated at similar to 18.6 cal ka BP Termination 1(18 6-11.1 cal ka BP) is interrupted by an unstable period of extreme seasonality, rather than a cooling event, between 14.4 and 13 2 cal ka BP, synchronous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR). The Holocene Maximum is observed between 11 6 and 98 cal ka BP and is typified by the most southward position of the northern margin of the ACC A cooling phase occurred during the early Holocene (until similar to 7 cal ka BP) and during the last similar to 0 8 ka. Our data indicates that the SE Pacific (41 degrees S) climate has been influenced over the whole record by changes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) high-latitudes, while during the mid to late Holocene, also a tropical forcing mechanism was involved, including the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the variable Hadley cell intensity Furthermore, this study showed a relationship between the variable morphology of the spines/processes of O. centrocarpum and the combined variation of sea surface salinity and temperature (SSS/SST-ratio).

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM-LINE ALTITUDES; ABRUPT CLIMATE-CHANGE; VALLEY GLACIERS; GREENLAND; ICE; INTERVAL; RECORDS; NORWAY	In explaining the rapid transitions associated with the Younger Dryas cooling, a reduced meridional overturning circulation has traditionally been invoked, but such a scenario has been difficult to reproduce in model studies without adding excessive amounts of freshwater to the North Atlantic. More recent Studies challenge this view and indicate that the role of an extensive sea ice cover may have been as important in promoting abrupt climate change as reorganisations of the North Atlantic Ocean [Gildor, H, Tziperman, E., 2003. Sea-ice switches and abrupt climate change. Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society Of London Series A-Mathematical Physical And Engineering Sciences 361, 1935-19421. Based on glacier evidence from eastern Greenland [Denton, G.H., Alley, R.B., Comer, G.C., Broecker, W.S., 2005. The role of seasonality in abrupt climate change. Quaternary Science Reviews 24, 1159-1182] suggest that the seasonal temperature amplitude increased by about 20 degrees C during the Younger Dryas. Such a 'switching of seasonality' lends support to the idea of a fast-expanding sea ice cover, because it allows for extremely cold winters that are balanced by relatively mild summers. However, climatic interpretations based on the geometry and length of glaciers under such conditions as in Scoresby Sund is not well understood, and equilibrium-line-altitude (ELA) estimates should, therefore, be regarded as tentative. Here, we discuss the absolute seasonal amplitude during the Younger Dryas by taking winter precipitation into account and show that the changes in seasonality may have been limited to 10 degrees C. We propose that by reducing the seasonal response in Greenland compared with western Europe we better understand the hinged-door modus operandi [COHMAP. 1988. Climatic changes of the last 18,000 years: observations and model Simulations. Science 241, 1043-1052] of the polar front and sea-ice cover, where the absolute Southward migration of sea-ice is highest in the East Atlantic region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reconstructing the changing patterns of sea ice distribution in the recent past remains one of the outstanding challenges to the paleo-community. To evaluate the importance of these reconstructions we performed sensitivity tests using NCAR's Community Climate Model (CCM3), and a series of prescribed sea ice extents designed to capture the full range of Arctic sea ice variability under interglacial (Holocene) and full glacial (Last Glacial Maximum) boundary conditions. Our simulations indicate that surface temperatures and sea level pressures in winter (DJF) are most sensitive to changes in sea ice, and that these changes are propagated over the surrounding land masses in the North Atlantic, but that equivalent changes in sea ice produce smaller corresponding changes in temperature or sea level pressure in the North Pacific region. A comparison between CLIMAP (Map Chart Series MC36, Geological Society of America, Boulder, CO, 1981) and a more realistic assessment of LGM sea ice yields dramatic changes in winter temperatures and precipitation patterns across Eurasia. These differences, forced only by changed sea ice conditions, reinforce the need to develop accurate maps of past sea ice to correctly simulate Late Quaternary environments. Such reconstructions also will be essential to validate the next generation of sea ice models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Climate variability across the last deglaciation in NW Iberia and its margin	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Deglaciation; Heinrich Stadial 1; Bolling-Allerod; Younger Dryas; Westerlies; Iberia	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RESERVOIR AGE-CHANGES; NORTH-ATLANTIC; PLANKTONIC-FORAMINIFERA; HEINRICH EVENTS; MAGDALENIAN SOCIETIES; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; DANSGAARD-OESCHGER; VEGETATION CHANGES; LATE QUATERNARY	The direct comparison between marine and terrestrial data from the NW Iberian margin, core MD03-2697, allows us to accurately evaluate, without chronological ambiguity, the vegetation response to North Atlantic climate events across the last deglaciation. Comparison of MD03-2697 data with other marine and terrestrial records from a vast area stretching from the Azores to western (W) France, Iberia and its margin, the W Mediterranean and NW Africa reveals the importance of enhanced winter North Atlantic westerlies episodes in driving a heterogeneous regional climatic signal during particular events of the last deglaciation. Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)/Oldest Dryas is a complex event marked by three synchronous main phases (a: extremely cold/relatively wet; b: cool/dry; c: relatively warmer/increasing moisture availability) in regions directly influenced by the North Atlantic while it is characterized by a single phase (cold and dry) in most inland and high altitude areas. Changes in the strength and position of North Atlantic westerlies could explain the variability in moisture during HS1 from W Pyrenees to W Mediterranean. The Bolling-Allerod (B-A) event is marked by a synchronous progressive increase of ocean and atmospheric temperatures and precipitation from the Bolling to the Allerod in W Iberia and W Pyrenees contrasting with the Greenland temperature pattern. Mid-to high latitudes thermal contrast and the gradual strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) triggered the continuing enhancement of westerlies, and moisture, along this period. Finally, the Younger Dryas (YD) Stadial is characterized by a land-ocean synchronous returning cold conditions (but not so cold as HS1) and, although dry conditions persisted during this period, extreme winter precipitation occurrences might have affected the most coastal areas of north and central W Iberia and Pyrenees. In contrast, dry conditions persisted during the YD in the western Mediterranean regions. The westerlies migrated further north following the displacement of the Polar Front during the deglaciation precluding the input of moisture in the W Mediterranean region, which persisted very dry during the YD Stadial.

Hydrochemical characteristics, controlling factors and solute sources of groundwater within the Tarim River Basin in the extreme arid region, NW Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Hydrochemistry; Groundwater; Controlling factors; Solute sources; Tarim River Basin	ECOLOGICAL WATER CONVEYANCE; MAJOR ION CHEMISTRY; TAKLIMAKAN DESERT; NORTHERN XINJIANG; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SHIYANG RIVER; LOWER REACHES; MINQIN BASIN; EJINA BASIN; EVOLUTION	In the extreme arid region of the Tarim River Basin (TRB), groundwater is the most valuable resource for people's lives and regional ecology. Major ion concentrations of groundwater were analyzed to decipher hydrochemistry, temporal and spatial variations, solute sources, and controlling factors of the groundwater within the TRB. Groundwaters in this area were neutral to alkaline in nature and most of them were hard-brackish waters, dominated by Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, and SO4 ions. The total dissolved solid (TDS) varied over two orders of magnitude with a mean value of 2044 mg/L in wet season and 3091 mg/L in dry season, about 1-2 times higher than those in river water in this area. Hydrochemical types and chemical compositions of groundwaters showed zonal distribution. Mineral dissolution and evaporation were the main processes responsible for high solutes in groundwater. Ion exchange between Na on clay minerals and Ca (Mg) in groundwater increased Na+ concentrations. Groundwater was oversaturated with respect to dolomite, calcite and aragonite, and under-saturated with respect to gypsum and halite. A forward model of mass budget calculation showed that evaporite dissolution, carbonate weathering, silicate weathering, and atmospheric input contributed 58 +/- 14%, 25 +/- 12%, 13 +/- 2%, and 4 +/- 2% of the total dissolved cations on average in wet season, and 68 +/- 13%, 20 +/- 12%, 10 +/- 2%, and 2 +/- 1% in dry season for the whole basin, respectively. Spatial variations of rock weathering were significant, with higher evaporite dissolution in the southern basin, and higher carbonate weathering in the northern basin. Although anthropogenic inputs were minor, the majority of samples were not suitable for drinking with reference to TDS, F- and/or SO42-. These results can enhance the understanding of hydrochemical characteristics in desert environments and provide information for the material sources of Lop Nor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Trends of temporal and spatial patterns in potential evapotranspiration and related driving factors over southwestern China are evaluated for the period 1961-2009, based on data from 111 standard meteorological stations. The results showed that southwestern China is experiencing a statistical decrease of ETo at a rate of 5.0 mm/10 y during 1961-2009. This decrease mainly started in the 1980s when accelerated warming occurred, which reflected the existence of the "evaporation paradox". However, autumn ETo showed a similar inter-annual variation with temperature rise. In spatial characteristics, the statistically significant decrease of ETo mainly occurred in the lower altitude region, whereas stations with increases or non-significant decreases are mainly in higher altitude regions. Through the analysis, the driving factors are the following: (1) the decreased wind speed is the main driving force for ETo decrease because the higher saturated vapor pressure would restrain evaporation owing to the weak water vapor exchange under lower wind speed. (2) Increased sunshine hours lead to stronger evaporation. This influence mainly occurred in the Xizang plateau-Hengduan Mountains and Yunnan-Guizhou plateau. (3) The weakly increased precipitation is also linked to the decreased ETo because the precipitation increase will cancel the partially increased ETo. (4) The decreased relative humidity would cause a corresponding decline of saturated vapor pressure, which must lead to the rise of ETo. (5) Climate warming is not the crucial driving factor for ETo inter-annual variation, but the accelerated warming had some influence on summer and autumn ETo, especially during the period of 1991-2009. In addition, the topography also had some influence. Thus, variation is dominated by the comprehensive functions of multi-factors, owing to the complex nature of ETo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The reconstruction of tree cover suggests presence of woody plants through the entire analyzed time interval, although trees played only a minor role in the vegetation around Lake Billyakh prior to 14 ka BP (<5%). This result corroborates low percentages of tree pollen and low scores of the cold deciduous forest biome in the PG1755 record from Lake Billyakh. The reconstructed values of the mean temperature of the warmest month similar to 8-10 degrees C do not support larch forest or woodland around Lake Billyakh during the coldest phase of the last glacial between similar to 32 and similar to 15 ka BP. However, modern cases from northern Siberia, ca. 750 km north of Lake Billyakh, demonstrate that individual larch plants can grow within shrub and grass tundra landscape in very low mean July temperatures of about 8 degrees C. This makes plausible the hypothesis that the western and southern foreland of the Verkhoyansk Mountains could provide enough moist and warm microhabitats and allow individual larch specimens to survive climatic extremes of the last glacial. Reconstructed mean values of annual precipitation are about 270 mm during the last glacial interval. This value is almost 100 mm higher than modern averages reported for the extreme-continental north-eastern Siberia east of Lake Billyakh, where larch-dominated cold deciduous forest grows at present. This suggests that last glacial environments around Lake Billyakh were never too dry for larch to grow and that the insufficient summer warmth was the main factor, which limited tree growth during the last glacial interval. The n-alkane analysis of the Siberian plants presented in this study demonstrates rather complex alkane distribution patterns, which challenge the interpretation of the fossil records. In particular, extremely low n-alkane concentrations in the leaves of local coniferous trees and shrubs suggest that their contribution to the litter and therefore to the fossil lake sediments might be not high enough for tracing the Quaternary history of the needleleaved taxa using the n-alkane biomarker method.

Duration and severity of Medieval drought in the Lake Tahoe Basin	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Medieval climatic anomaly; Sidescan sonar; Holocene; Dendrochronology; Drought; Fallen Leaf Lake	NORTHERN SIERRA-NEVADA; MONO LAKE; CALIFORNIA; RECORD; CLIMATE; FIRE; FLUCTUATIONS; CALIBRATION; EUROPE; AGE	Droughts in the western U.S. in the past 200 years are small compared to several megadroughts that occurred during Medieval times. We reconstruct duration and magnitude of extreme droughts in the northern Sierra Nevada from hydroclimatic conditions in Fallen Leaf Lake, California. Stands of submerged trees rooted in situ below the lake surface were imaged with sidescan sonar and radiocarbon analysis yields an age estimate of similar to 1250 AD. Tree-ring records and submerged paleoshoreline geomorphology suggest a Medieval low-stand of Fallen Leaf Lake lasted more than 220 years. Over eighty more trees were found lying on the lake floor at various elevations above the paleoshoreline. Water-balance calculations suggest annual precipitation was less than 60% normal from late 10th century to early 13th century AD. Hence, the lake's shoreline dropped 40-60 m below its modern elevation. Stands of pre-Medieval trees in this lake and in Lake Tahoe suggest the region experienced severe drought at least every 650-1150 years during the mid- and late-Holocene. These observations quantify paleo-precipitation and recurrence of prolonged drought in the northern Sierra Nevada. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Brothers, D.

A diatom-conductivity transfer function is employed to infer past water balance. Further information has been extracted from the palaeo-record through calculation of diatom biovolume, rarefaction (species diversity) and concentration, and through the identification of diatom bloom events in core thin sections. The Nar diatom sequence is compared with oxygen isotope (delta O-18) and pollen records from the same sediment cores in order to test the respective roles of changes in climate and land cover. Diatom-inferred (DI) conductivity excluding bloom taxa and delta O-18 show very good correspondence for the first half of the record and demonstrate that this region experienced a period of century-scale drought prior to AD 540, with a subsequent rapid and simultaneous shift to fresher lake conditions and wetter climate. After a drier phase in the Nar record from AD 800-950, the period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (AD 950 -1400) was generally well watered. During the subsequent Little Ice Age (similar to AD 1700-1900), DI-conductivity and delta O-18 become decoupled. Thin sections reveal between 20 and 40 distinct diatom bloom events per century since AD 1100, with increasing frequency between AD 1700 and 2000. Human land-use changes evident in the pollen sequence may have influenced the diatom relationship with lake water conductivity in the later part of the record. None the less, diatom DCA axes do show a clear response to multi-decadal drought events within the last six centuries. Differences between the proxy-climate records from Nar Lake may be associated with the dissimilar thresholds to environmental fluctuations and non-stationarity in the response of different proxies through time. The palaeoclimate records from Nar show that arid periods occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean during the last two millennia that were more prolonged and extreme than those experienced in the last century.

Jensen Land, located on the north coast of Greenland. This is a land of extreme climate: polar desert conditions and a coast bound by a permanent sea ice cover. Our data covers the period from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 18-22 cal ka BP) into the Holocene. It records the history of a shelf-based glaciation with ice flowing eastward along the coast as well as two local valley glacier advances from the south during the Holocene. With ice on the coastal plain during the LGM, glaciolacustrine basins formed in marginal positions and in ice-dammed valleys to the south into the mountainous area of Peary Land. With the break-up of shelf-based ice there was a gradual marine inundation at which the marine limit formed at similar to 45 m a.s.l. This initial early Holocene ice advance from the south formed prominent valley mouth moraines, especially in Sifs valley. Here, both glaciolacustrine and marine sediments were remoulded and/or dislocated as thrust blocks into a moraine ridge spanning more than 1 km in width and >60 m in height. Radiocarbon ages of sediments incorporated in this moraine, as well as from on-lapping sediments, suggest that the moraine formed between 9.6 and 6.3 cal ka BP. Based on (14)C dating results, the youngest ice advance phase can be narrowed down to (14)C ages between similar to 5.5-5.0 cal ka BP. The recorded ice advances took place during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) for North Greenland, the last one close to the beginning of the Neoglacial cooling. During the HTM we have recorded a period of similar to 2500 years during which the north coast of Greenland - as opposed to today - experienced an absence to very restricted occurrence of land-fast or multi-year sea ice. This observation can be explained by the altitudinal and temporal distribution of beach-ridge complexes that must have formed by wave action and thus requiring at least partial open-water conditions. With a moisture source at hand, we propose that this lead to enhanced precipitation in the near-coastal areas which, coupled to documented HTM cold reversals, caused a lowered glaciation limit, and led to a positive mass balance and subsequent ice advance.

Here we focus on the Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) as a proxy for understanding seasonal human land use patterns and occupation of four southwest Tasmanian caves. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether caves at different altitudes were occupied in alternating seasons, and determine if the 'Patch Model' developed to explain the archaeological variability of late Pleistocene human behavior should be modified accordingly. The data presented here support the original observations that these sites, although reflecting extreme richness, were occupied in a punctuated seasonal manner with visits probably separated by a considerable time of unknown duration.

From 147 stations, regional characteristics of extreme precipitation are analyzed using a rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF). Non-parametric trend analysis and wavelet transformation analysis are applied to analyze the temporal variation of extreme precipitation. The results show that (1) 6 leading modes of extreme precipitation exist in the following area: east/north-eastern Yangtze, north/central Yangtze, south-eastern Yangtze, north-western Yangtze, western Yangtze and south/south-western Yangtze; (2) significant positive changes can be found for extreme precipitation averaged for the east/north-eastern Yangtze and the western Yangtze basin, and statistically significant abruption is detected in year 1986 for both regions; (3) significant negative trends can be detected over the north-western Yangtze basin with abruption in the years 1968 and 1990-1 and (4) long-term trends and inter-decadal oscillations of extreme precipitation can be found for 6 mode domains, but not constant periodicity. The increase in heavy precipitation in the middle-lower reaches can partly explain the frequent occurrence of floods in the 1990s. It is difficult to predict the trends of heavy precipitation for future years, but possible alternating of high-frequency extreme precipitation in the middle and lower reaches indicates flood disaster might be aggravated in the incoming decade of the 21st century in the Yangtze River Basin.

Both can be viewed as reflecting interactions between biological and behavioural cold adaptations, in the context of extreme climatic fluctuations during the Upper Pleistocene. Recent studies draw attention to the special difficulties these conditions posed for humans but few give sufficient regard to the need for adequate pre-adaptations, namely technologies for manufacturing complex clothing assemblages. It is argued here that pre-existing biological cold adaptations delayed the development of such technological capacities among Neanderthals, resulting ultimately in their extinction. In contrast, the greater biological vulnerability of fully modern humans promoted a precocious appearance of behavioural adaptations among some (though not all) groups, visible in the various archaeological markers of modern human behaviour.

Four indices that represent extreme precipitation events are selected and calculated. Maximum 5-day precipitation, simple daily intensity index and very wet day precipitation have increased significantly by 1.18 mm, 0.09 mm/d, and 6.75 mm per decade, respectively, while consecutive dry days have decreased at a rate of 5.83 days per decade during the study period. Changes in probability distribution functions of precipitation indices before and after the detected abrupt year also indicate a wetting trend. Generally, the linear trends of precipitation indices are spatially coherent. Approximately 79.0%, 83.8%, and 98.1% of the grid boxes show increasing trends for maximum 5-day precipitation, simple daily intensity index and very wet day precipitation, respectively, and the proportion of decreasing trends for consecutive dry days is 95.2%. Trends in most precipitation indices (except consecutive dry days) are highly correlated with total precipitation trends (p < 0.0001). Significant correlations between precipitation indices and Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode Index (also referred as Arctic Oscillation Index) in wintertime indicate that precipitation extremes in the study area are related to the Arctic Oscillation.

Mapping of 3400 km(2) indicates about 10% of the area aggraded in the late Holocene and formed regionally extensive alluvial fan and alluvial plain cut-and-fill terraces. Fan deposits have weakly developed gravelly soils and yielded a date of 3200-2950 cal yr BP from carbonized wood. Alluvial plain deposits have weakly developed buried sandy soils and provided a date of 2460-2300 cal yr BP from a terrestrial snail shell. Precipitation records were analyzed to form historical analogues to the late Holocene aggradation and to consider the role of climatic variability and extreme hydrologic events as drivers of the sedimentation. The historical precipitation record indicates numerous above-average events correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in the region, but lacks any significant reactivation of alluvial fan surfaces. The timing of aggradation from 3200 to 2300 cal yr BP correlates well with other paleoclimatic proxy records in the southwestern U.S. and eastern Pacific region, which indicate an intensification of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climatic pattern and rapid climate change during this period.

AD 800-1300. We developed a 2300-yr tree-ring chronology extending to 323 BC utilizing live and remnant Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) from the Tavaputs Plateau in northeastern Utah. A resulting regression model accounts for 70% of the variance of precipitation for the AD 1918-2005 calibration period. Extreme wet and dry periods without modern analogues were identified in the reconstruction. The MCA is marked by several prolonged droughts, especially prominent in the mid AD 1100s and late 1200s, and a lack of wet or dry single-year extremes. The frequency of extended droughts is not markedly different, however, than before or after the MCA. A drought in the early AD 500s surpasses in magnitude any other drought during the last 1800 yr. A set of four long high-resolution records suggests this drought decreased in severity toward the south in the western United States. The spatial pattern is consistent with the western dipole of moisture anomaly driven by El Nino and is also similar to the spatial footprint of the AD 1930s "Dust Bowl" drought.

Widespread and extreme CPYs were concentrated in the 16th and early part of the 17th centuries and did not occur again until the early 20th century. The 217-yr absence of extreme CPYs may have occurred during an extended period of low variance in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We mapped climatic boundaries for the interior Pacific Northwest based on the location of sites with similar precipitation variability indices. Three regions, the Northwest (based on chronologies from nine sites), the Southwest (four sites), and the East (five sites) were identified. Our results suggest that western juniper radial growth indices have substantial interannual variability within the northwestern range of the species (central Oregon), particularly when compared with western juniper growing in its eastern range (eastern Oregon, southeastern Idaho, and northern Nevada) and southwestern range (southern Oregon and northeast California). We suspect that the substantial differences in the variability of western juniper radial growth indices are linked to the influence of ENSO events on winter/spring precipitation amounts.

Intertidal and subtidal limpet species are frequently identified taxa of these archaeological deposits. We investigated whether shell delta O-18 of the limpet species Nacella deaurata is a valuable record of local sea surface temperature (SST) and ambient water delta O-18 (delta(18)Ow) fluctuations, and in turn can be tied to estimate the season of its exploitation by Holocene HGF. Sequential shell delta O-18 of modern species track seasonal changes of SST and delta(18)Ow. The comparison of shell delta O-18 profiles of N. deaurata and Nacella magellanica (a coexisting species) suggests the occurrence of distinct growth rate and physiological adaptations between species. Shell delta O-18 of zooarchaeological specimens of N. deaurata from Lanashuaia II suggests that animals were exploited predominantly in winter and that experienced similar environmental conditions of present day at similar to 1320 years BP. Results also indicate that N. deaurata is a valuable candidate for studying past seasonal changes in SST and delta(18)Ow in this southernmost part of South America. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

New insights on Arctic Quaternary climate variability from palaeo-records and numerical modelling	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							GREENLAND ICE-SHEET; SCALE GLACIAL LINEATIONS; POLAR NORTH-ATLANTIC; SEA-ICE; SEDIMENTATION-RATES; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; OCEAN; HISTORY; ARCHIPELAGO; FLOW	Terrestrial and marine geological archives in the Arctic contain information on environmental change through Quaternary interglacial-glacial cycles. The Arctic Palaeoclimate and its Extremes (APEX) scientific network aims to better understand the magnitude and frequency of past Arctic climate variability, with focus on the "extreme" versus the "normal" conditions of the climate system. One important motivation for studying the amplitude of past natural environmental changes in the Arctic is to better understand the role of this region in a global perspective and provide base-line conditions against which to explore potential future changes in Arctic climate under scenarios of global warming. In this review we identify several areas that are distinct to the present programme and highlight some recent advances presented in this special issue concerning Arctic palaeo-records and natural variability, including spatial and temporal variability of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Arctic Ocean sediment stratigraphy, past ice shelves and marginal marine ice sheets, and the Cenozoic history of Arctic Ocean sea ice in general and Holocene oscillations in sea ice concentrations in particular. The combined sea ice data suggest that the seasonal Arctic sea ice cover was strongly reduced during most of the early Holocene and there appear to have been periods of ice free summers in the central Arctic Ocean. This has important consequences for our understanding of the recent trend of declining sea ice, and calls for further research on causal links between Arctic climate and sea ice.

In Romania, little research on this issue has been done. The present study focuses on the analysis of the trends in daily extreme precipitation indices over a period of 53 years (1961-2013). Data sets of daily precipitation recorded in 34 weather stations were analyzed. Among them, three are located in the Carpathians and four on the Black Sea Coast. The main goal was to find out changes in extreme daily precipitation using a set of 13 indices adopted from the core indices developed by ETCCDMI adapted to suit to the studied area. The series of indices and their trends were generated using RClimDex software. The trends have been calculated by employing modified Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope. Generally, the climate of Romania has become wetter over the 53-yr period considered, especially in the northern regions, although the spatial distribution of the significant trend slopes in the area is extremely irregular. Based on fixed threshold indices analysis, extreme precipitation events are characterized by a decreasing in the total number of precipitation days (R0.1), and a dominant increasing trend for the number of isolated days with moderate and heavy precipitation (R5, R10).

The north-eastern part of the mountain range lacks many of these species and has clearly lower maxima of grassland species richness. While climatic and edaphic conditions of both regions largely overlap, their specific environmental history has been hypothesized to explain the exceptional richness in the south-western part. We explored an entire-Holocene record (9650 BC onwards), the first one from the northeastern part, to find out whether differences in history may explain regional patterns of species rarity and richness. We analysed pollen, macrofossils and molluscs and dated the sequence with 13 radiocarbon dates. We further reconstructed past human activities using available archaeological evidence. Based on this analysis, the Early-Holocene landscape was reconstructed as semi-open with broad-leaved trees (elm and lime) appearing already around 9500 BC. Lime reached a relative abundance of as much as 60% around 8700 BC. All analysed proxies support the existence of dense lime-dominated woodland during the forest optimum starting after climate moistening around 6800 BC, some 2200 years before the first signs of slight forest opening in the Late Neolithic. During the Bronze and Iron Ages, human pressure increased, which led to a decrease in lime and an increase in oak, hornbeam, grasses and grassland snails; nevertheless, forests still dominated the landscape and beech spread when human impact temporarily decreased. Colonisation after AD 1350 created the modern grassland-rich landscape. All available evidence confirmed an early post-Glacial expansion of broad-leaved trees, supporting the hypothesis on their glacial refugia in the Carpathians, as well as presence of closed-canopy forest well before the Neolithic. This environmental history was unfavourable for the survival of Early-Holocene forest-steppe species in the north-eastern White Carpathians and may explain the impoverished grassland flora compared to the south-western part. We conclude that contrasting Holocene histories may explain those patterns in species richness and distributions, which cannot be explained by recent environmental conditions alone.

Causal links between Nile floods and eastern Mediterranean sapropel formation during the past 125 kyr confirmed by OSL and radiocarbon dating of Blue and White Nile sediments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Nile; Blue Nile; White Nile; Quaternary; Palaeochannels; Floods; Sapropels; Source-bordering dunes	LATE QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTS; DEEP-SEA FAN; LATE PLEISTOCENE; CENTRAL SUDAN; STABLE-ISOTOPE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HOLOCENE; ETHIOPIA; MONSOON; AGE	It has long been hypothesised that beds of highly organic mud or sapropels seen in marine sediment cores retrieved from the floor of the eastern Mediterranean accumulated during times of high Nile fluvial discharge. Our recent fieldwork in the valleys of the Blue Nile, the White Nile and the main Nile has for the first time revealed a sequence of extreme flood episodes synchronous with sapropel units S5 (124 kyr), S4 (102 kyr), S3 (81 kyr), S2 (55 kyr) and Si (13.5-6.5 kyr). There are more weakly defined links with Nile floods and sapropel units S9 (240 kyr), S8 (217 kyr), S7 (195 kyr), S6 (172 kyr), but the dating error terms are too large to allow us to be too definite. During times of extreme floods over the past 125 kyr, wide distributary channels of the Blue Nile flowed across the Gezira alluvial fan in central Sudan and transported a bed load of sand and gravel into the lower White Nile valley. The sands were reworked by wind to form source-bordering dunes, all of which contain heavy minerals of Ethiopian provenance. These source-bordering dunes were active at 115-105 kyr, 60 kyr and 12-7 kyr, all times of extreme Blue Nile floods. The flood and dune sediments were dated using a combination of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon analyses. The Quaternary record of Nile floods discussed here shows a precessional signal and reflects episodes of stronger summer monsoon and more northerly seasonal movement of the ITCZ, linked to times of higher insolation in northern tropical latitudes. Progressive aggradation of Holocene Nile channels in northern Sudan has had a profound influence upon human settlement in the last 8 kyr. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Williams, M. A.

The studied sedimentary sequences contain a similar late Holocene record of vegetation and climate and show a progressive aridification trend since at least 5000 cal. yr BP, through a decrease in forest cover in this area. Long-term vegetation changes shown here (semi-desert expansion and Mediterranean forest decline) paralleled declining summer insolation. Decreasing summer insolation most likely impacted negatively on tree growing season as well as on winter precipitation in the area. Superimposed on the long-term aridification trend were multi-centennial scale periods characterized by forest reductions or increases in arid and halophytic plants that can be interpreted as produced by enhanced droughts and/or by local geodynamic processes. These are centered at ca. 4000, 3000-2500, and 1000 cal. yr BP, coinciding in timing and duration with well-known dry events in the western Mediterranean and other areas but could have also been generated by local sedimentary or geodynamic processes such as a marine transgression in a subsidence context and extreme wave events (EWEs).

The results demonstrate that very wet day precipitation, extremely wet day precipitation, simple daily intensity index, wet day precipitation, heavy precipitation days, and heavier precipitation days over the "Three-River Headwaters" region exhibit increasing trends during the study period, with wet day precipitation statistically significant. However, non-significant decreasing trends are found for other indices, including maximum 1-day precipitation, maximum 5-day precipitation, and consecutive wet days with exception of consecutive dry days. Additionally, the stations with significant variations are mainly distributed over the northern "Three-River Headwaters" region. Additionally, abrupt changes in non-significant increasing trend for R95p and R99p are observed in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and major periodic variations with periods of a 6-year and a 20-year occurring in the extreme precipitation. The contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation has non-significant increase in the research region. Changes in small scale atmospheric circulation indicate that the main part of the moisture over the study area is from the Indian Ocean via southwesterly wind during the summer monsoon period.

Long-term information about the history of drought is still limited because the instrumental records for many areas in north-central China go back only a few decades at best. This paper presents an earlywood width (EWW) chronology of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) in the Shimen Mountains, Tianshui, eastern Gansu, north-central China. The climate-response analysis shows that April July precipitation is the main factor limiting the earlywood growth of Chinese pines in the Shimen Mountains, Tianshui. Based on the EWW chronology, an April July precipitation reconstruction for the period A.D. 1629-2008 was developed for Tianshui. The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 41.6% of the observed precipitation variance during the period 1953-2008. Spatial analysis shows that the precipitation reconstruction contains a strong common drought signal for north-central China. Reconstructed drought events are compared to a precipitation reconstruction of Huashan and historical archives for north-central China. The results reveal common climatic extremes over much of north-central China. Moreover, some dry periods coincided with solar minima or volcanic eruptions over the past several hundred years. Multi-taper spectral analysis reveals the existence of significant 3.8-year (90%), 3.1-year (95%), 2.7-year (99%), 2.4-year (99%) and 2.0-year (99%) periods of variability. The linkages to the Asian-Pacific Oscillation Index suggest regional precipitation variations may be linked to the East Asian summer monsoon circulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

A 4000 yr old fossil assemblage in the Mare Aux Songes (MAS), southwest Mauritius, Mascarene Islands, contains bones of 100000+ individual vertebrates, dominated by two species of giant tortoises Cylindraspis triserrata and C. inepta, the dodo Raphus cucullatus, and 20 other vertebrate species (Rijsdijk, Hume, Bunnik, Florens, Baider, Shapiro et al. (2009) Mid-Holocene vertebrate bone Concentration-Lagerstatte on oceanic island Mauritius provides a window into the ecosystem of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus). Quaternary Science Reviews 28: 14-24). Nine radiocarbon dates of bones statistically overlap and suggest mass mortality occurred between 4235 and 4100 cal. yr BP. The mortality period coincides with a widely recognized megadrought event. Our multidisciplinary investigations combining geological, paleontological and hydrological evidence suggests the lake was located in a dry coastal setting and had desiccated during this period. Oxygen isotope data from a Uranium-series dated stalagmite from Rodrigues, an island 560 km east of Mauritius, supports this scenario by showing frequently alternating dry and wet periods lasting for decades between 4122 and 2260 cal. yr BP. An extreme drought resulted in falling water-tables at MAS and elsewhere on the island, perhaps deprived these insular vertebrates of fresh water, which led to natural mass mortalities and possibly to extirpations. In spite of these events, all insular species survived until at least the seventeenth century, confirming their resistance to climatic extremes. Despite this, the generally exponential increase of combined human impacts on islands including loss of geodiversity, habitats, and stocks of fresh water, there will be less environmental safe-haven options for insular endemic and native vertebrates during future megadrought conditions; and therefore will be more prone to extinction.

Initially, the models' skills in simulating extreme precipitation during 1961-2000 were assessed. Projected changes before 2050 under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) emission scenario A1B were also analyzed. Results show that although there are some biases in the model results, the three models capture well the geographic distribution of extreme precipitation observed in the last half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, the models tend to show limited skill in reproducing the observed inter-annual variations of such extreme precipitation events, including the dominant patterns and trends. Under SRES A1B, for the period of 2011-2050, the simple daily precipitation intensity (SDII) and the fraction of extreme precipitation in total annual precipitation (R95T) will increase significantly in all the river basins in China, while changes in other indices are different. The periodic changes in consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD) and the number of days with precipitation >= 10 mm/day (R10) are expected to be more pronounced in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin. In the South River Basin, such periodic changes maintain similar or slightly weakened magnitudes. From 2001 to 2050 in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin, extreme precipitation in spring shows no significant changes. In the South River Basin, R95T, SDII and the maximum 5-days precipitation amount (R5D) in summer show an increasing tendency, but in winter a weak decreasing trend is projected. The changes in precipitation-based indices indicate a higher probability of heavy rainfall or flood occurrence, particularly in the river basins in East China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Period accounts of the Jamestown colony's first decade indicate considerable stress that has begged satisfactory explanation. A baldcypress tree-ring study was initiated as an independent means of climatic reconstruction in the lower Chesapeake region. The findings clearly document severe drought during the first years of the Jamestown colony. The implications of this finding enrich and clarify the first-person accounts of stress due to famine, poor water quality, intercultural hostility, and extreme mortality. The results also demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary studies in historical archaeology and should encourage more routine consideration of climate as a significant factor in the historical events of the United States.

During the Late Pliocene (2.7-3.0 Ma), the northern subtropical and subpolar Pacific experienced warmer climate conditions than those of today. The first predominant polar assemblage maximum occurs in the North Pacific at approximately 2.45 Ma signifying this region's response to the initiation of significant northern hemisphere glaciation. North Pacific faunal data show that Late Pliocene (1.8-2.5 Ma) glacial maxima were only about half to two-thirds as severe as those which occurred during the Late Pleistocene. Low faunal assemblage variability during a 200 ka interval in the latest Pliocene (1.6-1.82 Ma) in the North Pacific indicates minimal variations in the surface water properties and climate conditions most like those which existed just prior to 2.5 Ma. A distinct change in faunal assemblage registered in sediments from Site 580 between 1.2 and 1.3 Ma marks the first cooling in the North Pacific comparable in intensity to those of the Late Pleistocene. Since approximately 1.26 Ma, high amplitude, high frequency variations in the North Pacific polar assemblage have continued to occur, providing further evidence that the interglacial/glacial extremes that characterize the Late Pleistocene have persisted since this time. The frequency distribution of North Pacific winter sea-surface temperature time series for the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene includes major concentrations of variance (power) centered at a frequency corresponding to a 41 ka period, with variance dominance of the temperature time series for the last 800 ka shifting to lower frequencies (approximately 110 ka period).

A total of 14 indices are used to assess changes in extreme temperature distributions. All the temperature-based indices show patterns consistent with a general warming trend. The regional occurrence of the increase in warm nights (TN90p: 2.17 days/decade) and warm days (TX90p: 0.97 days/decade), and decrease in cool nights (TN10p: -1.80 days/decade) and cool days (TXx: -0.86 days/decade) was detected in the past 52 years. Moreover, the trend magnitudes in cold/warm nights are larger than those in cold/warm days, which indicate that trends in minimum temperature extremes are more rapid than trends in maximum temperature extremes, consistent with a long-term decrease in DTR. The other indices, including TNn, TNx, SU25, TR20, FD0, ID0, GSL, and DTR, show statistically significant changes except for Maximum and minimum values of maximum daily temperatures (TXx and TXn) which have statistically insignificant slopes at individual stations and in regional mean trend. For the majority of stations, significant increases are detected for heat related extremes such as summer days and tropical nights (SU25 and TR20) as well as for maximum and minimum values of minimum daily temperatures (TNn and TNx); With the exception of diurnal temperature range (DTR) and maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), the other indices strongly correlate with annual mean temperature. In addition, there are high correlations among warm indices and among cold ones, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The key meteorological factors for ET0 and AI were also evaluated. The results showed that the annual mean ET0 had a significant declining trend at the rate of 1.29 mm per year and AI also had a slightly decreasing trend of 0.001 per year from 1961 to 2012. The abrupt change used by the M K method revealed that the year of abrupt change for ET0 was in 1983 and 1993, but AI did not have abrupt change from 1961 to 2012. The spatial distributions of the average annual ET0 exhibited a declining trend from northeast to southwest over the study region. The spatial change trends for AI were similar to ET0, which the decreasing trends were located in the most parts of YRB. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient analysis indicated that the change of sunshine hours was the major factors influencing the variability of ET0, followed by wind speed. However, the dominating factor of AI was relative humidity, followed by precipitation. The significant wavelet power spectra of ET0 were 4-6 year and 12-15 year and there were obvious periodic oscillations of 4-6 year, 8-12 year and 18-22 year for AI. The periodic variation of ET0 was similar in some degree with that of AI and both of them had the comparable main periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The target region of this study is confined to eastern China, with most of the country's population concentrated, where both the wet and drought climate extremes can cause considerable damages to the economy, particularly to agriculture. From the inter-annual and intraseasonal scale, temporal and spatial distributions of climate extremes for 27 stations in the Huaihe River Basin over the period 1960-2013, are examined rigorously by means of a modified FAO Penman-Monteith method and the standardized variables of the monthly Surface Humid Index. Morlet wavelet analysis is utilized to thoroughly investigate the oscillation and periodicity of extreme wet/drought events during four seasons, as well as the whole year. The results suggest that the frequency of extreme wet events has significantly increased by 0.0118 times/year, whereas the trend for extreme drought events has gradually decreased, at the rate of 0.0127 times/year, both of which are in accordance with inter-decadal variations of climate extremes. Comparative study reveals climate extremes in autumn shows great differences, in sharp contrast to other seasons and the general inter-annual tendency. Spatial distributions of inter-annual extreme climate events exhibit certain symmetry characteristics, from west to east, indicating the combined influences of topography and monsoon circulation. The major cycles of extreme wet and drought events are 14 years and 24 years, respectively. Finally, possible causes of the temporal and spatial distributions of climate extremes are tentatively analyzed, by correlation analysis of six indexes, namely, AOI, AAOI, EASMI, WNPMI, SASMI, and NAOI, with AOI and NAOI being the dominant indexes under the background of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Additionally, other factors such as total annual precipitation, northward movement and enhancement of the subtropical anticyclone, and anthropogenically induced greenhouse forcing can also contribute to the changes in extreme climate events.

Information of the surface extent of all the lakes on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent areas was extracted from Landsat images obtained in the 1970s, the 1990s, around 2000, and 2010 and developed a lake spatial database. The dynamic changes of the number and lake surface area in the past forty years were analyzed. All lakes with areas larger than 10 km(2) that were suitable for the surface area change analysis, were selected to compare the dynamic changes. The meteorological data show that the climate of the study area changed from warm dry to warm wet gradually. Lake variations differ from area to area in different periods, and the response to climate fluctuation is strong. During the 1970s-1990s, lakes in southwest Qinghai and the southeast of the study area shrank, whereas lakes in other places tended to expand. The lakes in southwest Qinghai are mainly supplied by glaciers, snow meltwater, and surface runoff, whereas the lakes in the southeast of the study area are mainly recharged by runoff and precipitation. During this period, the temperatures were steady and there was insufficient runoff or glacial melt water to recharge lakes in southwest Qinghai. The water supply decreased due to decreasing precipitation in the southeast. During the 1990s to around 2000, lakes in the south expanded whereas other lakes shrank. The temperatures rose rapidly during this period, which accelerated melting of glaciers and snow. Decreased precipitation is a key factor responsible for the lake decline in the north. From 2000 to 2010, nearly all the lakes expanded due to increasing temperatures and precipitation. Decreased evaporation led to reduction of lake water loss. Analysis included factors responsible for the changes, i.e., tectonics, climate, glaciers, human activities, lake basin shape, and open or closed systems and catchments.

However, dendroclimatology has not been widely applied in the coniferous forests of Central Asia. Tree cores of Picea Schrenkiana from four sites in the Hutubi River Basin were developed into a 606-year tree-ring width chronology. The analyses showed that the tree-ring width indices highly correlate with mean April-May PDSI in the Hutubi River Basin. Mean April-May PDSI of the Hutubi River was reconstructed using the tree-ring data with 41.5% of the variance explained. The reconstructed series contains both high-and low-frequency climate signals. Our new PDSI reconstruction agrees reasonably well with the dry and wet periods previously estimated from tree rings in western Tien Shan. The results reveal common climatic extremes over much of Central Asia. Spatial analysis shows that the PDSI reconstructions have strong common signals for the Tien Shan. The first principal component of PDSI reconstructions in Tien Shan is significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The linkages to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggest the connection of regional moisture variations to the Asian monsoon and the Westerlies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

We show that (inter)glacial cycles in sediment color and %CaCO3 pre-date major northern hemisphere glaciation and are unambiguously and consistently correlated to benthic oxygen isotopes back to 3.3 million years ago (Ma) and intermittently so probably back to the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. We show these lithological cycles to be driven by enhanced glacial fluxes of terrigenous material (eolian dust), not carbonate dissolution (the classic interpretation). Our radiogenic isotope data indicate a North American source for this dust (similar to 3.3-2.4 Ma) in keeping with the interpreted source of terrestrial plant wax-derived biomarkers deposited at Site U1313. Yet our data indicate a mid latitude provenance regardless of (inter) glacial state, a finding that is inconsistent with the biomarker-inferred importance of glaciogenic mechanisms of dust production and transport. Moreover, we find that the relation between the biomarker and lithogenic components of dust accumulation is distinctly non-linear. Both records show a jump in glacial rates of accumulation from Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, G6 (2.72 Ma) onwards but the amplitude of this signal is about 3-8 times greater for biomarkers than for dust and particularly extreme during MIS 100 (2.52 Ma). We conclude that North America shifted abruptly to a distinctly more arid glacial regime from MIS G6, but major shifts in glacial North American vegetation biomes and regional wind fields (exacerbated by the growth of a large Laurentide Ice Sheet during MIS 100) likely explain amplification of this signal in the biomarker records. Our findings are consistent with wetter-than-modern reconstructions of North American continental climate under the warm high CO2 conditions of the Early Pliocene but contrast with most model predictions for the response of the hydrological cycle to anthropogenic warming over the coming 50 years (poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones).

These activity-level estimates are based on site-specific hurricane strike histories derived from proxy records of overwash events attributed to landfalling major hurricanes. Here we present a 7000 year composite record from two adjacent wetland sites in coastal Belize, Central America that records both tropical cyclone-generated storm surges and large precipitation events. Although overall sensitivity appears to decrease over time, this record displays clear evidence of continuous oscillation between distinctly different activity regimes, with active and quiet periods each covering similar to 50% of the record. Active periods occur during similar to 200-600 BP, 1450-2600 BP, 3200-4200 BP, 4750-5450 BP, 5750-6050 BP, and 6700-6900 BP. This activity pattern does not match regional records from the northern Gulf of Mexico, the northern Caribbean or the Atlantic coast of the USA, thereby supporting the view that activity patterns are temporally variable throughout the North Atlantic, and that hyperactivity does not occur simultaneously across the entire basin.

Higher taphonomic alteration among Holocene shells suggests lower sedimentation rates or higher shell-destruction rates than during glacial conditions. Shells preserved the aragonitic composition despite differing degree of skeleton damage. Shell delta C-13 values were -10.3 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, -8.2 23 parts per thousand, and -7.3 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand for modern, Holocene and late-glacial individuals, respectively. Higher delta C-13 values during the late-glacial and some Holocene periods imply higher water stress of C-3 plants and/or higher limestone contribution than today. Intrashell delta C-13 values were higher during juvenile stages suggesting higher limestone ingestion to promote shell growth. Shell delta O-18 values were -1.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand, -0.9 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand and -0.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand for modern, Holocene and late-glacial specimens, respectively. A snail flux-balance model suggests that during similar to 12.1 - 10.9 cal ka BP conditions were drier and became wetter at similar to 8.4 - 63 cal ka BP and today. Intrashell delta O-18 profiles reveal that glacial individuals experienced more extreme seasonality than interglacial shells, despite possible larger hibernation periods. Shell size correlated positively with delta O-18 values, suggesting that growth rates and ultimate adult size of C. nemoralis may respond to climate fluctuation in northern Spain.

The annual rainfall amounts of the 1922-2005 series for 16 stations spread throughout the country were used, as recorded in the files of the Agency for Air Navigation Safety (ASECNA-Cotonou). In addition, investigations in the environment have been conducted to understand the impacts experienced by communities. The data and information collected were processed using statistical tools and maps. Analysis shows a strong incidence of extreme rainfall during the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the south, while the 1970s and 1980s recorded very dry years. In all cases, wet and dry years pose problems for rural and urban communities. The projected climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall and drought and their consequences, and development policies must take that into account.

However, the glacial history of the Tibetan Plateau is more poorly constrained than that of most other formerly glaciated regions such as in North America and Eurasia. On the basis of some field evidence it has been hypothesized that the Tibetan Plateau was covered by an ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Abundant field- and chronological evidence for a predominance of local valley glaciation during the past 300,000 calendar years (that is, 300 ka), coupled to an absence of glacial landforms and sediments in extensive areas of the plateau, now refute this concept. This, furthermore, calls into question previous ice sheet modeling attempts which generally arrive at ice volumes considerably larger than allowed for by field evidence. Surprisingly, the robustness of such numerical ice sheet model results has not been widely queried, despite potentially important climate ramifications. We simulated the growth and decay of ice on the Tibetan Plateau during the last 125 ka in response to a large ensemble of climate forcings (90 members) derived from Global Circulation Models (GCMs), using a similar 3D thermomechanical ice sheet model as employed in previous studies. The numerical results include as extreme end members as an ice-free Tibetan Plateau and a plateau-scale ice sheet comparable, in volume, to the contemporary Greenland ice sheet. We further demonstrate that numerical simulations that acceptably conform to published reconstructions of Quaternary ice extent on the Tibetan Plateau cannot be achieved with the employed stand-alone ice sheet model when merely forced by paleoclimates derived from currently available GCMs. Progress is, however, expected if future investigations employ ice sheet models with higher resolution, bidirectional ice sheet-atmosphere feedbacks, improved treatment of the surface mass balance, and regional climate data and climate reconstructions.

I argue that the successes of the past are of equal importance, and this is increasingly recognized as early agricultural techniques are rediscovered and reinstated. Some of these systems are not only more sustainable than modern technologies, but more resilient in the face of environmental extremes. Ancient engineering and agricultural methods are often more appropriate for developing countries than modern technologies based on fossil fuel and imported materials. As global warming and desertification increase, it is crucial that we learn how to deal with marginal environments in ways that are sustainable and accessible to people in developing countries. Sustainable agriculture can also benefit the developed world by increasing yields, promoting biodiversity and supporting the rural economy.

PDB. In contrast, coeval ostracode and bivalve records from the Lake Huron and Lake Michigan basins are characterized by extreme delta O-18 variations, ranging from values that reflect a source that is primarily glacial (similar to -20% PDR) to Much higher values characteristic of a regional meteoric Source (similar to -5%. PDB). Re-evaluated age models for the Huron and Michigan records yield a more consistent delta O-18 stratigraphy. The striking feature of these records is a sharp drop in delta O-18 values between 9400 and 9000 cal yr BP. In the Huron basin, this low delta O-18 excursion was ascribed to the late Stanley lowstand, and in the Lake Michigan basin to Lake Agassiz flooding. Catastrophic flooding from Lake Agassiz is likely, but a second possibility is that the low delta O-18 excursion records the switching of overflow fro the Lake Superior basin from all undocumented northern Outlet back into the Great Lakes basin. Quantifying freshwater fluxes for this system remains difficult because the benthic ostracodes in the glaciolacustrine varves of Lake superior and Like Agassiz may not record the average delta O-18 value of surface water.

Vegetation surveys with an estimation of the tree-crown cover (%) were made in 10 m X 10 to plots to relate the vegetation to surface pollen of moss polsters. Correlation calculations show a close relationship between vegetation (tree-crown cover) and pollen for the Juniperus site (eg, r(2) = 0.76 between crown cover and arboreal pollen, AP) and the Picea site (r(2) = 0.85), whereas the link-age is weaker at the Juglans site (r(2) = 0.35) and in mixed forests (r(2) = 0.32). The results of the surface samples of moss polsters are compared and discussed with surface samples of lake sediments that were taken at the same locations. We use vegetational maps from around the lakes to discuss the link between vegetation and pollen at extra-local scales (800 m around the sites). These comparisons show that AP underestimates the effective tree cover around all sites, with in extreme cases densely forested areas corresponding to AP values as low as < 60; 30%. We explain this finding by the prevalent background pollen load that derives from the dry lowland and slope steppes (Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae). Our investigation may improve the reconstruction of Quaternary vegetation and climate history of these forest belts in Kyrgyzstan (Central Asia) on the basis of fossil pollen assemblages from mire and lake sediments. It provides new insights into the pollen reflection of forest isles (eg, on humid slopes or mountain tops) that are surrounded by continental steppes; a vegetational situation that may be used as an analogue for the conditions during the full glacial in Eurasia and Northern America.

Recognition of non-Milankovitch sea-level highstands at 185 and 343 thousand years ago from U-Th dating of Bahamas sediment	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							CARBONATE PLATFORM; HUON PENINSULA; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; SALINITY; SEAWATER; ISLAND; MODEL; LINKS	Thirty-one new bulk-sediment U-Th dates are presented, together with an improved delta O-18 stratigraphy, for ODP Site 1008A on the slopes of the Bahamas Banks. These ages supplement and extend those from previous studies and provide constraints on the timing of sea-level highstands associated with marine isotope stages (MIS) 7 and 9. Ages are screened for reliability based on their initial U and Th isotope ratios, and on the aragonite fraction of the sediment. Twelve 'reliable' dates for MIS 7 suggest that its start is concordant with that predicted if climate is forced by northern-hemisphere summer insolation following the theory of Milankovitch. But U Th and 6180 data indicate the presence of an additional highstand which post-dates the expected end of MIS 7 by up to 10 ka. This event is also seen in coral reconstructions of sea-level. It suggests that sea-level is not responding in any simple way to northern-hemisphere summer insolation, and that tuned chronologies which make such an assumption are in error by approximate to 10 ka at this time. U-Th dates for MIS 9 also suggest a potential mismatch between the actual timing of sea-level and that predicted by simple mid-latitude northern-hemisphere forcing. Four dates are earlier than that predicted for the start of MIS 9. Although the most extreme of these dates may not be reliable (based on the low-aragonite content of the sediment) the other three appear robust and suggest that full MIS 9 interglacial conditions were established at 343 ka. This is approximate to 8 ka prior to the date expected if this warm period were driven by northern-hemisphere summer insolation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A precipitation dataset released by the National Meteorological Information Center, China Meteorological Administration is applied as the observation series. The result indicates that changes in seasonal and annual precipitation can be simulated by the four gridded datasets in most regions of Xinjiang, but there are seasonal and regional discrepancies in the correlation coefficients (R), mean bias error (MBE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Generally speaking, the gridded datasets can be more effective in simulating precipitation in low-lying basins, that is, the elevation is less than 1500 m (mainly desert and scattered oasis), while RMSE in mountainous areas is much larger than that in low-lying areas. In Altay, Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains, the precipitation simulated by the gridded datasets is less than that of observation series. The accuracy of gridded precipitation datasets generally decreases with elevation. On a seasonal basis, the errors of gridded precipitation datasets in summer months are generally higher than those in other seasons, and RMSE usually shows low values during wintertime. Among the four gridded precipitation datasets, RMSE of CRU is slightly larger than other three datasets in most areas of Xinjiang. The wetting trend magnitude in this study area from 1979 to 2010 is generally underrated by all the gridded datasets, indicating that the long-term precipitation trend using gridded datasets should be treated with caution.

Here, I have integrated the data from all vegetation proxies obtained for the paleontological sites of Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj (i.e. macroscopic plant remains, pollen and phytolith assemblages, carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios measured on carbonates, and organic biomarkers). This important, yet discontinuous botanical record suggests some similarities between past and present-day vegetation at the regional scale: Afromontane forests with Olea, Podocarpus, Juniperus, Hagenia abyssinica in the highlands, and wooded grasslands with grasses and drought-adapted Acacia, Commiphora, Capparidaceae, and Chenopodiaceae and/or Amaranthaceae in the lowlands were present in the southern Serengeti Crater Highlands region since 4 Ma. Grasses of the C-4 photosynthetic type made their first appearance in the record at similar to 3.7 Ma, i.e. during the mid-Pliocene, similar to 700 ky before major pCO(2) and temperature decline. C-4 grasses became dominant in the vegetation soon after (similar to 3.66 Ma), probably in response to reduced precipitation. At similar to 2.6 Ma, phytolith and isotope indicate grassland with abundant C-4 xerophytic grasses that document strong aridity during the Intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation period (similar to 2.7-2.5 Ma). After 2 Ma, the detailed and diverse record at Olduvai indicates complex vegetation patterns linked to oscillating precipitation, varying lake levels, and the presence of geological faults. Hence, despite low (basin-averaged) reconstructed paleo-precipitation amounts of similar to 250-700 mm/y, C-4-grasslands, closed woodlands, wetlands, and palm-groves co-occurred on short spatial scales near saline Lake Olduvai. Freshwater wetlands and palm-rich woodlands occurred in highly localized areas on the lake margins, where aquifer barriers and/or outcrops caused by geologic faults allowed groundwater discharge. Botanical evidence of paleo-springs at Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj includes the marked presence of Typha (cattail) and Hyphaene (palm tree) in association with Acacia pollen grains, and (at Olduvai) abundant forest indicator phytoliths and organic and isotopic biomarkers. At Olduvai, freshwater wetlands were most developed when lake level and fluvial competence where low, i.e. during dry periods. When wet dry climate variability was extreme in East Africa (similar to 1.9-1.7 Ma), freshwater springs may therefore have offered a sustainable habitat (i.e. refuge) for several species, including hominins, and favored hominin and artifact concentration at these specific places, particularly during environmentally stressful times.

We use log (Ti/Ca) derived from X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to document terrigenous input from riverine runoff that integrates rainfall from the Guayas River catchment. We find that rainfall-induced riverine runoff has increased during the Holocene and decreased during the last deglaciation. Superimposed on those long-term trends, we find that rainfall was probably slightly increased during the Younger Dryas, while the Heinrich event 1 was marked by an extreme load of terrigenous input, probably reflecting one of the wettest period over the time interval studied. When we compare our results to other Deglacial to Holocene rainfall records located across the tropical South American continent, different modes of variability become apparent. The records of rainfall variability imply that changes in the hydrological cycle at orbital and sub-orbital timescales were different from western to eastern South America. Orbital forcing caused an antiphase behavior in rainfall trends between eastern and western equatorial South America. In contrast, millennial-scale rainfall changes, remotely connected to the North Atlantic climate variability, led to homogenously wetter conditions over eastern and western equatorial South America during North Atlantic cold spells. These results may provide helpful diagnostics for testing the regional rainfall sensitivity in climate models and help to refine rainfall projections in South America for the next century.

For waters around New Ireland and the Bismarck Sea, Delta R values ranging from 365 to -320 C-14 yr have been reported (Kirch 2001; Petchey et al. 2004). Petchey et al. (2004) proposed that some of this variation was caused by seasonal reversals in the South Equatorial Current and North Equatorial Counter Current system, combined with Ekman upwelling from the Equator. McGregor et al. (2008) suggested additional complexity within this region caused by a change in the reservoir value over time in response to changing climatic conditions. We present a series of 14 new and extant published. R and R values on historic shells, combined with 8 values from archaeological terrestrial/marine pairs and U-Th dated coral, that support observations of localized variability caused by a complex interplay between seasonal currents, riverine input, and ocean eddies. On the basis of these values and oceanographic data, we divide the Bismarck Sea surface marine C-14 reservoir into 6 tentative subregions. In particular, our results support significant variation within channels at the southwest and southeast ends of New Britain and towards the equatorial boundary of the sea. Our results indicate that within the Bismarck Sea geographical variation appears to be more extreme than temporal over the last 3000 yr.

Chronologies for each site are constructed based on 155 radiocarbon-dated peat samples. At the multimillennial scale, debris-flow activity was greatest during the transition from the Holocene Thermal Maximum to the late Holocene (c. 4300-2800 cal. BP) when debris-flow events occurred with a frequency of 1 in 33 years: two peaks in activity, characterized by 1 event in 14 years and 1 event in 25 years, were reached at the beginning and end of this interval, respectively. Least activity occurred during the Holocene Thermal Maximum from c. 8000 to 7100 cal. BP, with one event in 900 years. Eight distinct century- to millennial-scale phases of high debris-flow frequency (>3 events per 100 years) are identified at c. 8300-8000, 7100-7000, 4300-3700, 3200-2800, 2200-1900, 1500-1200, 800-700 and 300-0 cal. BP. Similarities in the records from the three sites suggest underlying climatic variations linked to the frequency of intense summer and autumn rainfall events M the primary meteorological trigger of slope failure in the source areas). Differences between the records reflect local site sensitivity to the initiation of debris-flow activity and the triggering of each subsequent debris-flow event. It is also inferred that each debris-flow system passes through multimillennial stages of at first increasing and later decreasing sensitivity as its source area expands. The climatic signals in the debris-flow record appear to differ in various respects from those derived from other precipitation-sensitive proxies from southern Norway (river floods, snow avalanches and glacier variations). Debris-flow records provide, therefore, complementary information relating to extreme climatic events and demonstrate instabilities in the Holocene landscape but provide little or no support for the concept of an increasing landscape impact of debris flows in response to global warming.

The tree rings of 20 samples were measured and dated by 24 AMS C-14 dates. A mean ring-width chronology has thus been obtained, spanning, though discontinuously, 5220 to too 14 C BP (5990-65 cal.

As the tree-ring width in dry lands depends mainly on water availability, the mean ring-width chronology represents a detailed record of changes in rainfall on a decade scale for the middle and late Holocene of the central Sahara. It indicates main drought spells at 5200-5000 C-14 BP (5900-5760 cal. BP) and at 4350 BP (5120 cal.

Radiocarbon-dated lithologies are compared for estuarine sites on windward and leeward coasts, interior peat bogs ranging from 169 to 1220 m in elevation, prehistoric fishponds, and a sinkhole paleolake in the Maha'ulepu cave system. Terrestrial sedimentation begins in many coastal sites about 6000 cal BP, as sea level approached modem levels. Prehuman sedimentation rates were quite low in all these sites, generally <2 mm/yr, although coastal sites in the late Holocene were subject to major episodic sediment influx from extreme events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods. Interior sites are generally older, having accumulated humic clay and peat layers at least since the late Pleistocene. Since the arrival of humans less than two millennia ago, sedimentation rates have increased in some coastal sites, and further local increases (as much as two orders of magnitude) have occurred since European arrival. Evidence from sites containing fossils of extinct terrestrial snails is consistent with the hypothesis that human-caused extinctions have proceeded in three phases, corresponding to losses (generally the largest species) occurring soon after the arrival of the first humans, followed by a second wave of extinction in late prehistoric times, and a third after European colonization. Dating of sediments from fishponds constructed or enhanced by prehistoric Polynesians suggests that this early form of aquaculture was initiated on Kaua'i by about 830 &PLUSMN; 50 BP. The most elaborate example of fishpond construction in the Hawaiian Islands, the Alekoko or Menehune fishpond on Kaua'i's southeast coast, was probably undertaken by 580 &PLUSMN; 30 BP.

The major goal of this study is to test (1) the reproducibility of the delta(13)C and delta(18)O signals within palaeosols and (2) their variation from one palaeosol to the other. The palaeosols that are expected to have formed under different palaeoenvironmental palaeoclimatic or diagenetic conditions provide isotopic signatures (delta(13)C and z delta(18)O) that can be clearly distinguished. In other words the differences between analytical results from the same palaeosol are much smaller than between samples from different palaeosols. This would mean that climatic or environmental changes are recorded as significant differences in isotopic signature. Carbon isotopic compositions vary between -11.5 and +2.0 parts per thousand. The relatively larger delta(13)C variations may be explained by climatically induced changes in floral composition. Changes in humidity are translated into variations of C-3 and C-4 plant proportions, resulting in changes in soil CO2 delta(13)C values. The extreme delta(13)C values found would correspond to nearly single 'phase' C-3 (delta(13)C: -11.5 parts per thousand) or C-4 (delta(13)C: +2.0 parts per thousand). Variations in the oxygen isotopic composition are much smaller, and range between -6.5 parts per thousand and -3.5 parts per thousand. These smaller differences can be induced by temperature changes.

There seems to be a consensus that during MIS2 extreme dry conditions prevailed over north-eastern Africa, which was apparently not occupied by humans. The Nile Valley seems to be an exception; numerous field data have been collected suggesting an important population density in Upper Egypt during MIS2. The occupation remains are often stratified in, or at least related to, aeolian and Nile deposits at some elevation above the present-day floodplain. They are rich in lithics and animal bones, mainly fish, illustrating the exploitation of the Nile Valley by the Late Palaeolithic inhabitants. The fluvial processes active during that period have traditionally been interpreted as a continuously rising highly braided river. In this paper we summarize the evidence thus far available for the Late Pleistocene on the population densities in the Nile Valley, and on the models of Nilotic behaviour. In the discussion we include data on the environmental conditions in Eastern Africa, on the aeolian processes in the Western Desert of Egypt derived from satellite images, C-14 and OSL dates, in order to formulate a new model that explains the observed high remnants of aeolian and Nilotic deposits and the related Late Palaeolithic sites. This model hypothesizes that, during the Late Pleistocene, and especially the LGM, dunes from the Western Desert invaded the Nile Valley at several places in Upper Egypt. The much reduced activity of the White Nile and the Blue Nile was unable to evacuate incoming aeolian sand and, as a consequence, several dams were created in the Upper Egyptian Nile Valley. Behind such dams the created lakes offered ideal conditions for human subsistence. This model explains the occurrence of Late Palaeolithic hunter fisher gatherers in a very arid environment with very low Nile flows, even in late summer. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Here, we present a new stacked, high-resolution, precisely-dated speleothem stable isotope record from the northern Alps, which provides an important record of temperature and moisture-source changes between 134 and 111 ka for Europe and the wider North Atlantic realm. The record encompasses the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II (TII)), which lies beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating, thus providing an important new archive for a crucial period of rapid paleoclimate change. Warmer and wetter ice-free conditions were achieved by 134.1 +/- 0.7 ka (modelled ages) as indicated by the presence of liquid water at the site. Temperatures warmed further at 133.7 +/- 0.5 ka and led into an interstadial, synchronous with slightly elevated monsoon strength during the week monsoon interval. The interstadial experienced an unstable climate with a trough in temperature associated with a slowdown in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and a reduction in North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation. The interstadial ended with a more extreme cold reversal lasting 500 years in which NADW formation remained active but the sub-polar gyre weakened allowing cool polar waters to penetrate southwards. The main warming associated with TIT was very rapid, taking place between 130.9 +/- 0.9 and 130.7 +/- 0.9 ka coeval with initial monsoon strengthening. Temperatures then plateaued before being interrupted by a 600-year cold event at 129.1 +/- 0.6 ka, associated once again with penetration of polar waters southwards into the North Atlantic and a slowdown in monsoon strengthening. Sub-orbital climate oscillations were thus a feature of TII in the north Atlantic realm, which broadly resemble the Bolling/Allerod-Younger Dryas-8.2 ka event pattern of change observed in Termination I despite monsoon records indicating strong differences between the last and penultimate deglaciation.

The multi-proxy reconstruction of climate change impacts and social responses and the comparative study between typical periods form an effective tool for elucidating the mechanisms of the interactions. In this paper, with a reconstruction of the proxy series of famine, migration and wars, the most typical social consequences related to climate change and disasters (flood/drought) in North China in 1470-1911 were quantitatively described, and two typical periods of human-climate interaction with similar climate change backgrounds (cold periods of the Little Ice Age'), which were the late Ming dynasty (1560-1644) and late Qing dynasty (1780-1911), were selected and compared. It is determined that the climate deterioration (rapid cooling and increasing extreme disasters) in the late 16th and 18th centuries both resulted in severe social consequences characterized by more famine and popular unrest. The differences were that the climatic impacts in the late Ming were much more serious, and interregional migration, which was an effective responsive measure in the late Qing, was not important in the late Ming; they were primarily influenced by three factors based on the analytical framework of the impacts of historical climate change and social responses: (1) climate deterioration in the late Ming was more severe (more rapid cooling and more extreme disasters), (2) social system were more sensitive to climate change in the late Ming because of its mode of agricultural production (especially cropping system and crop species), and (3) the capacity of social response to climate disaster, especially disaster relief and refugee settlement, was considerably greater in the late Qing.

Data on sediment composition were used to characterize changes in the depositional environment during the ontogenetic development of the Lake Temje. The analysis of fossil chironomid remains and statistical treatment of chironomid data by the application of a newly developed regional Russian transfer functions provided inferences of mean July air temperatures (T-July) and water depths (WD). Reconstructed WDs show minor changes throughout the core and range between 80 and 120 cm. All the fluctuations in reconstructed water depth lie within the mean error of prediction of the inference model (RMSEP = 0.35) so it is not possible to draw conclusions from the reconstructions. A qualitative and quantitative reconstruction of Holocene climate in central Yakutia recognized three stages of palaeoenvironmental changes. The early Holocene between 10 and 8 ka BP was characterized by colder-than-today and moist summer conditions. Cryotextures in the lake sediments document full freezing of the lake water during the winter time. A general warming trend started around 8.0 ka BP in concert with enhanced biological productivity. Reconstructed mean T-July were equal or up to 1.5 degrees C higher than today between 6.0 ka and 5.0 ka BP. During the entire late Holocene after 4.8 ka BP, reconstructed mean T-July remained below modern value. Limnological conditions did not change significantly. The inference of a mid-Holocene climate optimum supports scenarios of Holocene climatic changes in the subpolar part of eastern Siberia and indicates climate teleconnections to the North Atlantic realm.

Evidence from genetics, prehistoric archaeology, pollen analysis, stable isotope geochemistry, geomorphology, ice cores, and climate models has provided some useful working hypotheses.

Minimizing the edge-effect in environmental reconstructions by trimming the calibration set: Chironomid-inferred temperatures from Spitsbergen	HOLOCENE			English	Article						extreme habitats; inference model; midges; numerical edge-effect; palaeolimnology; response functions	MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD; AIR TEMPERATURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WESTERN SPITSBERGEN; INFERENCE MODELS; RADIOCARBON AGE; LAKE; SVALBARD; ASSEMBLAGES; SEDIMENTS	A core from Lake Skardtjorna on western Spitsbergen was analysed for subfossil chironomids with the aim of inferring past temperatures. The core spans the last 1760 years and has a low concentration and low diversity of chironomids. Three taxa dominate the record: Oliveridia tricornis, Micropsectra radialis-type, and M. insignilobus-type, the latter not previously recorded on Svalbard. Compared with the full Norwegian modern climate-chironomid calibration data set, Skardtjorna is at the coldest end of the modern temperature gradient. In an attempt to decrease potential bias caused by the numerical edge-effect and to improve the taxon response functions, the training set was trimmed by excluding lakes dissimilar to the study site. Two trimming approaches are tested. In the first, lakes at the warm end of the gradient are excluded. In the second, the calibration data-set lakes are partitioned by TWINSPAN on the basis of their modern chironomid assemblages, and lakes most dissimilar to Skardtjorna are excluded. According to the training-set performance diagnostics, a WA-PLS inference model excluding lakes > 9 degrees C has the most promising results (component 1, R-2 = 0.85, maximum bias = 0.58 degrees C, RMSEP= 0.73 degrees C). The performance diagnostics based on the trimmed inference model out-performs the performance diagnostics from the full model, and the reconstructed temperatures indicate different trends. According to the < 9 degrees C inference model, the long-term temperature trend has been decreasing, with cold periods 1630-1450, 1150-1050, and around 250 cal. yr BP. Warm periods occurred between 1760 and 1650, 1420 and 1180, and 1000 and 830 cal. yr BP. Temperatures have been increasing during the last 250 years.

Cosmogenic isotope exposure ages of desert pavement and welded, calcic gypsic salic Reg soils that developed on relatively flat alluvial surfaces similar to 2 Ma ago in the Negev Desert indicate long geomorphic stability under extremely dry conditions. Over a short interval during their initial stage of development between 1-2 Ma, these cumulative soils are characterized by calcic soils reaching maximum stage Ill of carbonate morphology. This interval is the only period when calcic soil horizons formed on stable abandoned alluvial surfaces in the southern Negev Desert. Since similar to 1 Ma pedogenesis changed toward more arid soil environment and the formation of gypsic salic soil horizons that were later followed by dust accumulation. The dichotomy of only moderately-developed calcic soil (stages II-III) during a relatively long time interval (10(5)-10(6) years) indicates an arid environment that does not support continuous development but only occasional calcic soil formation. The very low delta O-18 and relatively high delta C-13 values of these early pedogenic carbonates support soil formation under arid climatic conditions. Such an environment was probably characterized by rare and relatively longer duration rainstorms which occasionally allowed deeper infiltration of rainwater and longer retention of soil moisture. This, in turn enabled the growth of sparse vegetation that enhanced deposition of pedogenic carbonate. At similar to 1 Ma these rare events of slightly wetter conditions ceased and less atmospheric moisture reached the southern Negev Desert leading to deposition of soluble salts and dust deposited in the soils. The combination of long-term hyperaridity, scarcity of vegetation and lack of bioturbation, salts cementation, dust accumulation and tight desert pavement cover, has protected the surfaces from erosion forming one of the most remarkably stable landscapes on Earth, a landscape that essentially has not eroded, but accumulated salt and dust for more than 10(6) yr.

Here we use elemental variations generated by scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to identify droughts and floods in recently deposited (1755-2008) sediments of Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) from box core SPR0901-04BC. The first principal component (PC1) of the scanning XRF elements has high loadings for elements associated with the lithogenic component of SBB laminae couplets, while the second (PC2) is associated with biogenic components. We interpret PC1 as a proxy for river runoff and PC2 as a proxy for marine productivity. High values of PC1 are associated with El Nino events and positive (warm) phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while low values of PC2 are associated with El Nino events and negative (cool) phases of the PDO. Droughts such as the 1934-40, 1949-56, and 1989-91 events coincide with low PC1 values. In addition to distinguishing interannual and decadal variability in the elemental composition of SBB sediments, several historic floods can be recognized including a gray flood layer associated with the 1861-62 flood, and a peak in PC1 associated with the flood following the St. Francis Dam disaster in 1928.

It clearly defines the variability, extreme events, and changes in daily flow records over the past 4 decades. The results of this study accurately determine the seasonal cycle of river discharge, including the range of highest and lowest daily flows. The interannual variation of daily flow is generally small in the cold season, highest in the spring melt period, and large over the summer months mainly due to rainfall storm activities and associated floods. This study also shows that Mackenzie River flow regime has changed over the past 4 decades due to climate variation, with the advance of snowmelt peak timing by several days, decrease in maximum spring flows by about 3000 m(3)/s, and weak rise of cold season base flows. These results are the consequence of hydrological response to regional climate warming, and they provide new knowledge to improve our understanding of large-scale environmental changes over the broader northern regions.

In this study, we aim on detailed reconstruction of climatic fluctuations and related changes in the frequency of flood and dust deposition events at ca. 3300 and especially at 2800cal. yr BP from high-resolution sediment records of the Dead Sea basin. A ca. 4-m-thick, mostly varved sediment section from the western margin of the Dead Sea (DSEn - Ein Gedi profile) was analysed and correlated to the new International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project core 5017-1 from the deep basin. To detect even single event layers, we applied a multi-proxy approach of high-resolution microscopic thin section analyses, micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) element scanning and magnetic susceptibility measurements, supported by grain size data and palynological analyses. Based on radiocarbon and varve dating, two pronounced dry periods were detected at similar to 3500-3300 and similar to 3000-2400 cal. yr BP which are differently expressed in the sediment records. In the shallow-water core (DSEn), the older dry period is characterised by a thick sand deposit, whereas the sedimentological change at 2800 cal. yr BP is less pronounced and characterised mainly by an enhanced frequency of coarse detrital layers interpreted as erosion events. In the 5017-1 deep-basin core, both dry periods are depicted by halite deposits. The onset of the younger dry period coincides with the Homeric Grand Solar Minimum at ca. 2800 cal. yr BP. Our results suggest that during this period, the Dead Sea region experienced an overall dry climate, superimposed by an increased occurrence of flash floods caused by a change in synoptic weather patterns.

The analytical results showed that both the temperature and the precipitation have increased significantly (0.35 degrees C/10 y, 11.2 mm/10 y) during the period of 1960-2011. An abrupt change was detected to have occurred in 1986 for temperature and in 1987 for precipitation. Autumn was the season when the temperature increased most dramatically, and winter and autumn were the seasons when the precipitation increased most dramatically. The twenty years after 1990 were the warmest and wettest two decades of the past similar to 50 years, but the warming and wetting paces have slowed down during the same period. The results also showed that the mean annual minimum temperature increased more dramatically than the mean annual maximum temperature, resulting in a greatly reduced diurnal range. The reasons or mechanisms for rising trend of temperature during the past 50 years and also for the faster rising rate of the temperature in northern Xinjiang and the adjacent areas have been reasonably explored in published literature. However, the reasons or mechanisms for the rising trend of the past 50-year precipitation in northern Xinjiang and the adjacent areas have not been reasonably explored. This wetting trend has not extended further to the surrounding areas including Republic of Mongolia, major part of North China, and five republics of the former Soviet Union, and the need is thus pressing to explore the reasons or mechanisms behind this relatively "localized" wetting trend.

In this study, based on date from 58 standard meteorological stations, the spatio-temporal variations and trends of ET0 and AI were calculated for the Loess Plateau Region (LPR) from 1961 to 2012 using the Mann-Kendall test, the moving t-test, and the Morlet wavelet methods. The results demonstrated: (1) the annual ET0 displayed a statistically significant decrease of -10.3 mm/10 y (P < 0.05) during 1961-2012. At that time, AI also had a decreasing trend of -0.013/10 y over the past 52 years. Compared with ET0, the inter-decadal variations of AI over the LPR seemed to show similar declined trends. (2) Spatially, about 81% stations displayed a decreasing trend for annual ET0 during 1961-2012, and most of them were distributed in the western, northern and southeastern LPR. In addition, about 60% of stations showed statistically decreasing trends for AI, and the major decreases were mainly in the east Qinghai division and northern LPR. (3) Abrupt changes were detected in annual ET0 series in the 1980s and in annual AI series in 1987. Wavelet analysis indicated significant 2 year and non-significant 7, 10 and 14 years in annual ET0 series, and there existed periods of 4, 8 and 12 years for AI. (4) For ET0, wind speed was the most sensitive meteorological factor, followed by sunshine hours, precipitation, and relative humidity. For AI, ET0 and precipitation were the sensitive factors. This study provides an understanding of the effect of recent climate change on hydrological cycle in the LPR. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

In this study, on the basis of daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 62 meteorological stations in the Yellow River basin, the changes in 13 indices of temperature extremes recommended by the ETCCDI were investigated in the Yellow River basin from 1961 to 2011. Both cold extremes and warm extremes showed a warming trend, with a large proportion of stations having statistically significant trends for most temperature indices. Because of a faster increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased by -0.07 C degrees/decade. For cold extremes indices, i.e. coldest night (TNn), coldest day (TXn), cool nights (TN10p), cool days (TX10p), frost day (FD) and icing day (ID), the trends during the period of 1961-2011 were 0.23 and 0.22 C degrees/decade, and -5.23, -3.31, -2.61 and -3.16 days/decade, respectively. For warm extremes, i.e. warmest night (TNx), warmest day (TXx), warm nights (TN90p), warm days (TX90p), warm spell duration index (WSDI) and growing season length (GSL), the trends were 0.20 and 0.21 C degrees/decade, and 3.80, 3.26, 2.93 and 4.81 days/decade, respectively. In general, the indices have the largest change magnitudes in the arid and semi-arid subregions, followed by the high-elevation sub-region, and the indices have the smallest changes in the eastern monsoon sub-region. Relationships between the changes in the temperature extremes and the changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulations were studied. Results show that the changes in the temperature extremes were consistent with the changes in the area and strength of Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High (NHSH) and Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex (NHPV).

Detailed characterisation of the layers allows the discrimination of the sedimentation processes involved, such as surface runoff, landslides or subaqueous slope failures. These processes can then be interpreted in terms of their triggering mechanisms. Here we present a 40 ka event layer chronology from Lake Suigetsu, Japan. The event layers were characterised using a multi-proxy approach, employing light microscopy and mu XRF for microfacies analysis. The vast majority of event layers in Lake Suigetsu was produced by flood events (362 out of 369), allowing the construction of the first long-term, quantitative (with respect to recurrence) and well dated flood chronology from the region. The flood layer frequency shows a high variability over the last 40 ka, and it appears that extreme precipitation events were decoupled from the average long-term precipitation. For instance, the flood layer frequency is highest in the Glacial at around 25 ka BP, at which time Japan was experiencing a generally cold and dry climate. Other cold episodes, such as Heinrich Event 1 or the Late Glacial stadial, show a low flood layer frequency. Both observations together exclude a simple, straightforward relationship with average precipitation and temperature. We argue that, especially during Glacial times, changes in typhoon genesis/typhoon tracks are the most likely control on the flood layer frequency, rather than changes in the monsoon front or snow melts. Spectral analysis of the flood chronology revealed periodic variations on centennial and millennial time scales, with 220 yr. 450 yr and a 2000 yr cyclicity most pronounced. However, the flood layer frequency appears to have not only been influenced by climate changes, but also by changes in erosion rates due to, for instance, earthquakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This region is highly prone to changes in the hydrological cycle under predicted climate warming in particular with respect to aridity periods, rainfall variability and the occurrence of extreme flood events. This paper presents 15 exposures covering a time span of the last 44 ka, which were documented in the field and of which seven exposures were soil-chemical analyzed regarding soil texture, organic matter, as well as carbonate and iron content. Ages are based on radiocarbon dating on 32 samples. Latest Holocene sediments were found within the channel-belt, where permanent remobilization of sediments takes place due to the migration of the meandering river course. In more distal floodplain positions, sediment sequences show a complex fluvial architecture referring to periods of varying character and intensity of alluviation as well as periods of geomorphic stability indicated by soil formation. Furthermore, sedimentation patterns vary along different river sections. Aggradations of coarse gravels took place between similar to 40 and 18 ka cal BP over the entire valley floor. Alluviation of fine material was documented between 17 and 16, at similar to 7.5, between 5.1 and 3.3, at 2.8, between 2.1 and 1.5, at similar to 1.0, and around 0.4 ka cal BP until recent times. Astonishingly in late Holocene times, between 4.2 and 3.1 ka cal BP, aggradations of coarse gravels even in distal floodplain areas overlap with sedimentation of fine material in adjacent river sections pointing to a complex constellation of parameters involved. Periods of soil formation were detected around 43, at 31, between 16 and 12.6, after 7.5 until 5.1, between 2.8 and 2.1 and at times after 1.5 ka cal BP. Phases of geomorphic stagnation were found at 38 ka cal BP and for a duration of 200 years at 3.0 ka cal BP and refer to absent geomorphic or pedogenic processes. All these patterns are an expression of the interaction between climatic variations, tectonic impulses and human influences. A comparison with other terrestrial archives enabled us to reconstruct late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental conditions on a regional scale, and furthermore to link specific stages of floodplain development to prevalent influencing variables. Thus, with emphasis on the fluvial system response, a model of a cause and effect relationship is presented, that concentrates on rapid climate changes, long-lasting climatic deteriorations and the role of human interventions.

Fieldwork in the Ubari sand sea and the Messak (Fazzan, Libya) through the Desert Migrations Project has identified numerous Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites both along the shores of interdunal palaeolakes and on the mountainous plateaus of the area, such as the Messak Settafet. In this paper, we describe some of the evidence for the MSA in Fazzan, and discuss it in the context of the African MSA more generally. We show that this MSA record exhibits considerable typological and technological variation, and discuss the implications for hypotheses relating to the colonization of desert environment and the expansion of hominins out of sub-Saharan Africa.

Presence of woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) can be identified from 23 Iberian sites, which is compiled and analyzed herein, and the fossil specimens from seven of these sites are described here for first time. Morphological and biometrical analyses demonstrate that the Iberian woolly rhinoceros did not significantly differ from individuals of other European populations, but represent the westernmost part of a continuous Eurasian belt of distribution. The first presence of woolly rhino in the Iberian Peninsula has been identified during the late Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene. However, the highest abundance of this species is recorded during MIS 3 and 2. The latest Iberian occurrences can be dated around 20 ka BP. The presence of woolly rhinoceros in the Iberian Peninsula correlates with periods of extreme dry and cold climatic conditions documented in Iberian terrestrial and marine sediment sequences. From a palaeobiogeographic point of view, the maximum southern spread of C antiquitatis on the Iberian Peninsula was registered during the late Middle Pleistocene or early Late Pleistocene, reaching the latitude of Madrid (about 40 degrees N). Subsequently, during MIS 3 and 2, all Iberian finds were restricted to the Northern regions of Iberia (Cantabrian area and Catalonia). The southern expansion of C. antiquitatis during the Late Pleistocene in the Iberian Peninsula reached similar latitudes to other Eurasian regions. The ecological composition of fossil assemblages with presence of woolly rhinoceros was statistically analyzed. Results show that temperate ungulate species are predominant at Iberian assemblages, resulting in a particular mixture of temperate and cold elements different of the typical Eurasian cold-adapted faunal associations. This particular situation suggests two possible explanations: a) Eventual migrations during the coldest time spans, resulting in a mixing of cold and temperate faunas, instead a faunal replacing; b) Persistence of woolly rhinoceros populations in the Iberian Peninsula during interglacial episodes confined at cryptic southern refugia.

The climate reconstruction, based on the Modern Analogue Technique, indicates warmer and drier conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). MWP was preceded by a short-lived cold humid event around AD 1060, and followed by a rapid return around AD 1400 to cooler and wetter conditions which generally characterize the Little Ice Age (LIA). Around AD 1450 (solar Sporer minimum), the LIA attained a temperature minimum and a summer precipitation maximum. The solar Maunder minimum around AD 1690 corresponded at Joux to rather mild temperatures but maximal annual precipitation. These results generally agree with other records from neighbouring Alpine regions. However, there are differences in the timing of the LIA temperature minimum depending on the proxy and/or the method used for the reconstruction. As a working hypothesis, the hydrological signal associated with the MWP and LIA oscillations at Lake Joux may have been mainly driven by a shift around AD 1400 from positive to negative NAO modes in response to variations in solar irradiance possibly coupled with changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

The Lago Fagnano region, at similar to 54 degrees 30'S and similar to 68 degrees W, has experienced several phases of glacier growth and retreat since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We illustrate these phases using combined geomorphological, geophysical and coring surveys in Lago Fagnano itself, a similar to 105 km-long, E-W-oriented glacio-tectonic basin. We identify and map a complex set of submerged frontal, central and lateral moraines covered by lacustrine sediments using seismic stratigraphic analysis of multi-channel profiles imaging the sub-lake floor. We then combine these geophysical data with field observations and regional maps of similar structures around the lake to reconstruct the spatial behavior of the Fagnano paleo-glacier since the LGM. We interpret the preserved frontal moraines as having formed during at least 20 re-advance stages of the glacier within a long-term deglaciation interval post-LGM. Preliminary tephrochronological dating of a similar to 7.5 m long core indicates a step-wise deglaciation pattern comprising a final glacier re-advance stage at similar to 11.2 ka BP.

Paleoclimatic implications of glacial and postglacial refugia for Pinus pumila in western Beringia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Refugium; Seasonality; Pollen; Northeastern Siberia; Beringia; Late Quaternary	HOLOCENE CLIMATIC CHANGES; SIMULATIONS; VEGETATION; RECORD; TREES; PALEOENVIRONMENTS; SENSITIVITY; PATTERNS; SHRUBS; NORTH	Palynological results from Julietta Lake Currently provide the most direct evidence to support the existence of a glacial refugium for Pinus pumila in mountains of southwestern Beringia. Both percentages and accumulation rates indicate the evergreen shrub survived until at least similar to 19,000 C-14 yr BP in the Upper Kolyma region. Percentage data suggest numbers dwindled into the late glaciation, whereas pollen accumulation rates point towards a more rapid demise shortly after similar to 19,000 C-14 yr BP. Pinus pumila did not re-establish in any great numbers until similar to 81 00 C-14 yr BP, despite the local presence similar to 9800 C-14 yr BP of Larix dahurica, which shares similar Summer temperature requirements. The postglacial thermal maximum (in Beringia similar to 11,000-9000 C-14 yr BP) provided Pinus pumila shrubs with equally harsh albeit different conditions for survival than those present during the LGM. Regional records indicate that in this time of maximum Warmth Pinus pumila likely sheltered in a second, lower-elevation refugium. Paleoclimatic models and modern ecology suggest that shifts in the nature of seasonal transitions and not only seasonal extremes have played important roles in the history of Pinus pumila over the last similar to 21,000 C-14 yr BP.

This is partly a result of Holocene marine transgressions that prevent easy access to earlier coastal settlements. Nevertheless, the dependence on the sea seen in the Late Mesolithic seems to be a consequence of a long-established exploitation system. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures in human bone reflect a dominance of marine protein, while the zooarchaeological components of shell middens show a high species richness of exploited marine resources. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction suggests that more or less the whole range of resources exploited was accessible in the immediate vicinity of the sites. Seasonal aspects of the utilised and potentially available subsistence resources, along with stable isotope and lithic data, raise the possibility of restricted mobility for these populations, within relatively limited territories. The impression of extreme dependence of these coastal populations on the seashore might have been a key factor in their final disappearance, whether this is viewed as replacement or acculturation. Indeed, the Mesolithic communities of Brittany could have been caught between rising sea-levels and the arrival of Neolithic communities from the east and the south.

To investigate the relationship between isotopic variability and interannual climate change, we use the isotopic tracer version of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM). We generate interannual-type climate variability by specifying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies observed during extreme cool (1955-1956) and warm (1982-1983) phases of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system during January and July. In response to SST anomalies, the GCM simulates many tropical and extratropical climatic features typical of ENSO variability. Across the tropics, simulated isotopic anomalies correlate significantly with rainfall amount. At higher latitudes, altered pressure distributions set up surface wind changes that generate significant regional temperature anomalies. Extratropical deltaO-18 anomalies reach +/- 4-5 parts per thousand but in most regions do not correlate with temperature anomalies. We examine four regions from which interannual paleoclimatic and/or modem isotopic records are available: the tropical western Pacific, tropical South America, western-central Europe and the Tibetan Plateau. In the Pacific warm pool, the GCM quantitatively reproduces the observed inverse relationship between the amount and isotopic content of rainfall, which provides the basis for coral paleoclimatic reconstruction of ENSO-related rainfall anomalies. In tropical South America, isotopic anomalies also correlate strongly with precipitation amount, consistent with the hypothesis that air mass stability over the Amazon basin controls deltaO-18 variability downstream at the Quelccaya ice core site. In Europe, interannual temperature changes correlate positively with deltaO-18 anomalies, quantitatively consistent with long-term observations and supporting temperature-based interpretations of paleoclimatic records. On the Tibetan Plateau, isotopic variations do not correlate with local climatic anomalies nor with changes in oceanic vapor sources, suggesting a complex climatic signal in Tibetan ice cores possibly mediated by continental processes. In contrast to our interannual results, last glacial maximum (18 ka BP) simulations yield significant correlation between temperature and isotopic anomalies. The model thus suggests distinct modes of isotopic response to simulated climate variability that depend on the scale and processes of climate change. Interannual temperature changes often result from time-varying advective changes that can confound the relationship between temperature and isotopic variations, via changes in vapor sources and transport. The near-global temperature change associated with glacial-interglacial variations yields a more consistent pattern of isotopic variability because (1) the effects of large-scale cooling are integrated over the entire pathway of vapor transport and (2) the degree of cooling causes an isotopic response that exceeds the level of variability produced by advective changes.

Changing patterns of eastern Mediterranean shellfish exploitation in the Late Glacial and Early Holocene: Oxygen isotope evidence from gastropod in Epipaleolithic to Neolithic human occupation layers at the Haua Fteah cave, Libya	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th World Congress of the UISPP	2014	Burgos, SPAIN	UISPP		Season of collection; Shellfish foraging; Oxygen isotope; Mollusc; Epipalaeolithic; Neolithic	RADIOCARBON AGE CALIBRATION; MARINE MOLLUSK EXPLOITATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; OSILINUS-TURBINATUS; MONODONTA-TURBINATA; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; MESOLITHIC SITE; SEASONALITY; RESOURCES; GROWTH	The seasonal pattern of shellfish foraging at the archaeological site of Haua Fteah in the Gebel Akhdar, Libya was investigated from the Epipaleolithic to the Neolithic via oxygen isotope (delta O-18) analyses of the topshell Phorcus (Osilinus) turbinatus. To validate this species as faithful year-round palaeoenvironmental recorder, the intra-annual variability of delta O-18 in modern shells and sea water was analysed and compared with measured sea surface temperature (SST). The shells were found to be good candidates for seasonal shellfish forging studies as they preserve nearly the complete annual SST cycle in their shell delta O-18 with minimal slowing or stoppage of growth. During the terminal Pleistocene Early Epipaleolithic (locally known as the Oranian, with modeled dates of 17.2-12.5 ka at 2 sigma probability, Douka et al., 2014), analysis of archaeological specimens indicates that shellfish were foraged year-round. This complements other evidence from the archaeological record that shows that the cave was more intensively occupied in this period than before or afterwards. This finding is significant as the period of the Oranian was the coldest and driest phase of the last glacial cycle in the Gebel Akhdar, adding weight to the theory that the Gebel Akhdar may have served as a refugium for humans in North Africa during times of global climatic extremes. Mollusc exploitation in the Latest Pleistocene and Early Holocene, during the Late Epipaleolithic (locally known as the Capsian, c. 12.7 to 9 ka) and the Neolithic (c. 8.5 to 5.4 ka), occurred predominantly during winter. Other evidence from these archaeological phases shows that hunting activities occurred during the warmer months. Therefore, the timing of Holocene shellfish exploitation in the Gebel Akhdar may have been influenced by the seasonal availability of other resources at these times and possibly shellfish were used as a dietary supplement when other foods were less abundant.

In this paper, we present the results of a measurement campaign carried out in two periods of the year, which can be considered "extreme" from the meteo-climatic point of view, in the Classense Library located in the city of Ravenna (Italy). This is a famous Italian historical library that houses many books of great value. The campaigns took place one in the summer period (from July 22nd to August 6th 2014) and another one in winter (from 15th December to 30th December 2014). During these measurements campaigns, we have characterized different and heterogeneous indoor environments. The internal pollutants concentrations and thermo-hygrometric data have been compared with the external ones, obtained from nearby measuring points. In this way, we have been able to determine the Indoor/Outdoor ratio (I/0 ratio) of the pollutants concentrations. From these data and from the estimated air exchange rate, the pollutants deposition velocities have been calculated, too. The building has no air conditioning systems and our experimental data show that it is characterized by a relatively low rate of air exchange and a high thermal inertia. We have also compared the analysed microclimatic data with the specific values recommended by different norms and standards, in order to verify the conditions of preservation of the precious texts. Finally, we have applied a mathematical model to study the indoor pollutants concentrations, in order to confirm that the correlations between the outdoor and the indoor pollutants levels can be explained in terms of the building characteristics. The results of the model application fit well the experimental data and the consequent theoretical estimates made in this work; in fact, they are consistent with very low values of air exchange ratio of the building. These results can be used to define a specific "Performance Index" (PI) of the building, expressed as the percentage of time in which the microclimatic parameters of the library (i.e. the thermo-hygrometric values) do not match the recommended values. Furthermore, they can also provide a first step, based on experimental data, for the development, in close collaboration with the conservation scientists, of a methodology for risk assessment, specifically to be used for cultural heritage housed in museums, galleries and archives.

However, does a warmer climate also mean a moister climate? Does dry get drier and wet get wetter? There are important questions as they relate to changes in the water cycle and impacts the water resources as well as the frequency and intensity of storms and floods in the near future. In Europe, regional climate models do not show consistent and robust results for future hydroclimatic changes and how extreme events will evolve in response to future climate change. Paleo-hydroclimatic data from natural archives are one of the few means to assess such changes in the longer context. Here, we present an annually-resolved record of warm season (MJJA) precipitation and summer flood frequency from the varved (annually laminated) sediments of proglacial Lake Oeschinen (46 degrees 30'N-7 degrees 44'E, 1580 m, NW Swiss Alps) back to AD 884. These data sets are inferred from the thickness of annual sediment deposits and the occurrence of flood event layers in the sediments. The chronology of the sediment record is based on multiple varve counts and validated with historical floods chronicled in written documents (back to the 14th century) and C-14 AMS dates. The precipitation record shows pronounced interannual to centennial variability with humid warm season phases between AD 920-950, AD 1100-1180, AD 1300-1400, AD 1590-1650, AD 1700-1790, AD 1820-1880, and AD 1960-2008. Driest conditions are reconstructed for AD 960-1080, AD 1250-1300 and for AD 1880-1900. Our precipitation record is consistent with the few multi-centennial warm-season precipitation records available for Europe. We did not find a persistent relationship between warm-season precipitation and temperature. In contrast, results show that the relation between precipitation and temperature has oscillated between positive correlations (warmer gets wetter, cooler gets drier) and negative correlations (warmer gets drier, cooler gets wetter),with a highly significant (chi(2) = 99%) multidecadal (60-70 yrs) periodicity over the last millennium. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are changes in the weather type statistics or the within-weather-type variability, which influence the combinations between precipitation and temperature over continental central Europe and operate at multidecadal scales. Such multidecadal effects might also be important for precipitation scenarios in the Alpine area under future warming. Our record of flood frequency suggests more frequent floods under cool and humid climate during the warm seasons. This picture is consistent with other studies from small and medium size catchments at mid- and high elevations in the Alpine area. However, the 13th century reveals a period with high flood frequency during warm and moderately dry (average precipitation) conditions. This anomalous situation is currently not understood; nonetheless, this is also one out of several possible scenarios for the future. From the different combinations found in our record, we conclude that the relation between floods, precipitation and temperature and, in consequence, future projections remain poorly constrained.

Measuring the skill of variance-scaled climate reconstructions and a test for the capture of extremes	HOLOCENE			English	Article						climate change; "Medieval Warm Period'; palaeoclimate; regression; statistical methods; tree rings	NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE TEMPERATURES; TREE-RING WIDTHS; SUMMER TEMPERATURE; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; PRECIPITATION; RECORD; UNCERTAINTIES; VARIABILITY; DELTA-O-18; MILLENNIUM	Climate reconstructions produced using regression, with a proxy as the independent variable, are inevitably biased towards the mean, exhibit reduced variance and underestimate extremes. Scaling the mean and variance to fit those of the target climate data produces a more realistic range of reconstructed values but the cost, in terms of inflated error, is seldom assessed. We provide a simple metric that allows the loss of skill because of scaling to be quantified. It can be calculated retrospectively for published studies, some of which exhibit little or no reconstructive skill. Although scaled reconstructions must have a range that is close to that of the target climate data, there is no guarantee that the correct years are pushed to the extremes. We propose a simple non-parametric test for Extreme Value Capture' that gives the statistical significance of a given number of the correct years being captured' beyond the thresholds defined by the upper and lower 10% of the measured climate data. The methods are tested using three annually resolved case studies. A tree-growth-based summer temperature reconstruction for northern Fennoscandia captures cold summers very well, but the capture rate of the warmest summers is no better than might be expected purely because of chance. Such failure to correctly capture the warmest years has important implications for interpretation of the frequency and magnitude of very warm summers in the past.	[McCarroll, Danny; Young, Giles H.

Nevertheless, precise environmental contexts of archaeological artefacts may remain unknown due to an unclear stratigraphy and/or to the bad preservation of paleoenvironmental proxies. As pollen is badly preserved in glacial loess deposits, a compilation of age constrained high resolution molluscan records is used to initiate the establishment of a canvas of millennial timescale spatial and temporal environmental changes in the European Loess Belt during the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial (ca. 37-20 ka) to look for relationships with spatial distribution of human settlements. In this study, new terrestrial mollusc assemblages have been added to the database previously established for north-western Europe. They strengthen the position of the limit between the two molluscan-based biogeographical domains initially highlighted for north-western Europe: a flat and poorly vegetated western domain extending around the Channel and in Belgium, and a hilly domain with more diversified vegetation to the east. The analysis of molluscan data shows the persistence of these two domains throughout alternations of loess deposition phases (interstadial-stadial transitions and stadial phases) with phases of development and degradation of tundra gley horizon (stadial-interstadial transitions and interstadial phases). The interpretation of malacofauna from both domains combined with associated pedological and sedimentological features, climate modelling and comparisons with present tundra environments reveals a significant effect of both seasonality and snow cover along a longitudinal gradient between both domains, but also between phases of loess deposition and phases of tundra gley development. During interstadial phases, the intense functioning of the active layer and the degradation of permafrost in north-western Europe led to more homogeneous environments, which were less favourable for the diversity of both vegetation and terrestrial mollusc fauna. Presently, uncertainties of numerical ages still preclude precise correlations of loess units and tundra gley horizons between different sites and with nonlocal prehistoric occupations. However, a first raw comparison of the molluscan data with spatial distributions of Aurignacian, Gravettian and Solutrean-Upper Magdalenian lithic cultures reveals that the northern limit of the first two ones fits well with the south-eastern border of the poorly vegetated western domain also characterised by well-developed ice-wedge networks during phases of permafrost installation. Later, an important southward shift of human populations in western Europe resulted from the extreme aridity of the Last Glacial Maximum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Climate variability in south-eastern Australia over the last 1500 years inferred from the high-resolution diatom records of two crater lakes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Climate variability; Diatoms; High-resolution; South-east Australia; Little Ice Age	MULTI-DECADAL VARIABILITY; NEWER VOLCANIC PROVINCE; WESTERN VICTORIA; EL-NINO; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; REGIONAL COHERENCE; WATER DEPTH; TREE-RINGS; SALINITY	Climates of the last two millennia have been the focus of numerous studies due to the availability of high-resolution palaeoclimate records and the occurrence of divergent periods of climate, commonly referred to as the 'Medieval Climatic Anomaly' and The Little Ice Age'. The majority of these studies are centred in the Northern Hemisphere and, in comparison, the Southern Hemisphere is relatively understudied. In Australia, there are few high-resolution, palaeoclimate studies spanning a millennium or more and, consequently, knowledge of long-term natural climate variability is limited for much of the continent. South-eastern Australia, which recently experienced a severe, decade-long drought, is one such region. Results are presented of investigations from two crater lakes in the south-east of mainland Australia. Fluctuations in lake-water conductivity, a proxy for effective moisture, are reconstructed at sub-decadal resolution over the past 1500 years using a statistically robust, diatom-conductivity transfer function. These data are interpreted in conjunction with diatom autecology. The records display coherent patterns of change at centennial scale, signifying that both lakes responded to regional-scale climate forcing, though the nature of that response varied between sites due to differing lake morphometry. Both sites provide evidence for a multi-decadal drought, commencing ca 650 AD, and a period of variable climate between ca 850 and 1400 AD. From ca 1400-1880 AD, coincident with the timing of the 'Little Ice Age', climates of the region are characterised by high effective moisture and a marked reduction in interdecadal variability. The records provide context for climates of the historical period and reveal the potential for more extreme droughts and more variable climate than that experienced since European settlement of the region ca 170 years ago.

The hydrological model HBV-D was applied to simulate and project future stream flow based on a multi-model ensemble. As this implies high uncertainties, the magnitude of three uncertainty sources, i.e. emission scenarios, GCM structure, and downscaling techniques, were determined in relation to the observed and projected natural variability. The relative change in each uncertainty source and the overall dominance among the three sources were further analyzed. The changes in flood frequency are projected for five return periods (2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 years) and three future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). The results suggest that in comparison to the natural variability of the multi-model ensemble, the uncertainty sources show much stronger variations. The range of their relative change and their dominance vary with the lead-time and return period. In most of the return periods, the dominant uncertainty can primarily be attributed to downscaling techniques and emission scenarios, while GCMs structure is minor in the 2020s. However, downscaling technique is the second dominant source behind GCM structure, while emission scenarios represent the lowest uncertainty ranges of the three sources for the projected flood frequency in the 2050s and 2080s. The uncertainty and projected impact of climate change differs also between the four applied GCMs, as compared to the natural variability MK3_5 shows higher ranges than CCSM3, MK3_5 and ECHAM5. The upper bounds (95% percentile) in uncertainty mostly show an increasing tendency with increasing return period, and partially with increasing lead-time. Hence, the more extreme the return period (higher flood frequency) the higher is the uncertainty of the model projections. It is therefore essential that climate change impact assessments consider a wide range of climate scenarios derived from different GCMs under multiple emission scenarios and including several downscaling techniques. The uncertainty due to natural variability should also be considered more intensely. The projection of flood frequency and the identification and quantification of the uncertainties in the modeling is important for the implementation of adaptation policies into water resource planning in the Zhujiang River basin, South China. This study will enrich the scientific research on the uncertainty from different sources of modeling results in river basin parameters, and help to obtain conclusive results on the importance of different sources of uncertainty.

Combining phytoliths and delta C-13 matter in Holocene palaeoenvironmental studies of tropical soils: An example of an Oxisol in Brazil	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							SAO-PAULO-STATE; VEGETATION CHANGES; CARBON ISOTOPES; CHARCOAL; INDICATORS; FOREST; ASSEMBLAGES; CALIBRATION	Many plants deposit the soluble silica absorbed from the soil as monosilicic acid (H4SiO4) in and between their cells, generating bodies of opal silica (SiO2 center dot nH(2)O) called phytoliths. Although phytoliths are susceptible to dissolution under extreme pH conditions, they generally do remain in the soil for long periods of time and can help in the reconstruction of past vegetation and climates. In the present study, phytolith analysis was used to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions that contributed to the pedogenetic processes, the deposition of organic matter and its stabilization in a very thick (>1 m) umbric epipedon of a Humic Hapludox profile from Minas Gerais State (Brazil). The results from the phytolith assemblages were also compared to the fractions and isotopic data of soil carbon of the same profile. The result from studying these two palaeoenvironmental proxies together has shown that the environment under which the umbric epipedon was formed was a mixture of vegetation with predominance of C-3 plants in mesothermic conditions and with little variation in humidity since Middle Holocene.

Magnetic parameters reflecting pedogenesis in Pleistocene loess deposits of Argentina	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Congress of the International-Union-for-Quaternary-Research	JUL 28-AUG 03, 2007	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	Int Union Quaternary Res			CHINESE LOESS; BUENOS-AIRES; SEDIMENTS; RECORD; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PALEOCLIMATE; PALEOSOLS	Quaternary loess sequences of Argentina, with interbedded loess and buried soils (palaeosols), provide terrestrial records of past climates and environmental conditions. Study of rock magnetic parameters measured over a large area of the Pampean loess seems to indicate that the existing magnetoclimatological models cannot adequately account for the complexities of the Pampean loess. The Chinese loess has been considered as typical, where magnetic properties are largely controlled by pedogenesis. On the other hand, the Siberian loess is an alternative magnetoclimatological model in which palaeosols appear as magnetic lows and the intercalated loess as magnetic highs. Argentine loess is apparently closer to the Siberian model. However, considering the data obtained in Argentina, the situation seems to be more complicated. The higest magnetic values (SIRM and susceptibiliy values) in silty and sandy loess indicate a more efficient entrainment of dense iron oxides particles during stormy dry (glacial) intervals. The parent material shows the highest susceptibility values (> 100 x 10(-8) m(3)/kg) while the waterlogged horizons show the lowest ones (below 20 x 10(-8) m(3)/kg). Pedogenesis resulting in the development of BC and B soil horizons of palaeosols in the parent loess produced decreases in susceptibility values and increases in the F factor. This phenomenon occurs at some degree of humidity in which the process of gleying caused the total depletion of both susceptibility and frequency factor. The magnentic data allows consideration of the relevance of major cycles (arid/humid) separated by discontinuities as the main factor favoring one particular behavior of the magnetic parameters. The B horizons of palaeosols developed during an and cycle will not show a notable difference in the magnetic records from the parent material. In contrast, during humid climate condition the pristine loess can be progresively obliterated by pedogensis through to the extreme situation of gleying. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Regional tree growth and inferred summer climate in the Winnipeg River basin, Canada, since AD 1783	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Canada; dendrochronology; northwestern Ontario; Vaganov-Shashkin model; Winnipeg River	NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO; RECONSTRUCTION	A network of 54 ring-width chronologies is used to estimate changes in summer climate within the Winnipeg River basin, Canada, since AD 1783. The basin drains parts of northwestern Ontario, northern Minnesota and southeastern Manitoba, and is a key area for hydroelectric power production. Most chronologies were developed from Pinus resinosa and P strobus, with a limited number of Thuja occidentalis, Picea glauca and Pinus banksiana. The dominant pattern of regional tree growth can be recovered using only the nine longest chronologies, and is not affected by the method used to remove variability related to age or stand dynamics front individual trees. Tree growth is significantly, but weakly, correlated with both temperature (negatively) and precipitation (positively) during summer. Simulated ring-width chronologies produced by it process model of tree-ring growth exhibit similar relationships with summer climate. High and low growth across the region is associated with cool/wet and warm/dry summers, respectively; this relationship is Supported by comparisons with archival records from early 19th century furtrading posts. The tree-ring record indicates that summer droughts were more persistent in the 19th and late 18th century, but there is no evidence that drought was more extreme prior to the onset of direct monitoring.

Purpose of the research was to assess the quality of the coverage by means of key indicators such as accuracy, selection of information sources, amplification of political conflict, attention to hazard prevention and mitigation. The analysed sample is composed of 430 news stories of natural catastrophic events and related geological hazards in Italy in the above-mentioned time interval. News stories were selected from: (i) national print newspapers, (ii) national online newspapers and (iii) local print newspapers. The results here presented show that the Italian scientific and environmental print media convey messages that are often characterised by a lack of accuracy and pluralism; furthermore, environmental journalists often tend to shape their reports in such a way as to amplify political-, economic- and human-related implications of natural disasters. Moreover, journalists often avoid providing in-depth scientific coverage of natural causes of extreme geological events and hardly ever highlight the need to prevent and mitigate their consequences. Suggestions are made to take specific actions aimed at bridging the gap between scientists and the media in Italy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of the Wadi Mansurab gastropods reveals that the shell carbonate is highly depleted in C-13 and O-18. Th, highly depleted oxygen isotopic composition is indicative of rainfall derived from a distant oceanic source. The highly negative nature of the oxygen isotopes indicates that the region had significantly less evaporation than today while the extreme variability in isotopic composition (up to 6-7 parts per thousand PDB) is consistent with a seasonal rainfall regime, characterized by a high degree of inter-annual variability. The dominance of semi-aquatic and swamp-dwelling gastropods over truly aquatic species implies that the region was probably a seasonally flooded grassplain similar to the toich-lands of south-central Sudan today. Our data support the inference that towards 8500-7000 BP there was a stronger southwest monsoon and an associated northward shift in the summer rainfall zone, which caused the Wadi Mansurab region in north-central Sudan to be seasonally flooded during a wetter and possibly cooler period with lower rates of evapotranspiration. From 8500 to 7000 BP, lake levels were high elsewhere in northern Africa, suggesting a regionally wetter climate at that time.

Proxy records of Holocene storm events in coastal barrier systems: Storm-wave induced markers	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; SOUTH-CAROLINA COAST; INTENSE HURRICANE STRIKES; STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES; BEACH-RIDGE FORMATION; LARGE-SCALE WASHOVER; LAST 6500 YEARS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; SEDIMENTARY RECORD	Extreme storm events in the coastal zone are one of the main forcing agents of short-term coastal system behavior. As such, storms represent a major threat to human activities concentrated along the coasts worldwide. In order to better understand the frequency of extreme events like storms, climate science must rely on longer-time records than the century-scale records of instrumental weather data. Proxy records of storm-wave or storm-wind induced activity in coastal barrier systems deposits have been widely used worldwide in recent years to,document past storm events during the last millennia. This review provides a detailed state-of-the-art compilation of the proxies available from coastal barrier systems to reconstruct Holocene storm chronologies (paleotempestology). The present paper aims (I) to describe the erosional and depositional processes caused by storm-wave action in barrier and back-barrier systems (i.e. beach ridges, storm scarps and washover deposits), (ii) to understand how storm records can be extracted from barrier and back-barrier sedimentary bodies using stratigraphical, sedimentological, micro-paleontological and geochemical proxies and (iii) to show how to obtain chronological control on past storm events recorded in the sedimentary successions. The challenges that paleotempestology studies still face in the reconstruction of representative and reliable storm chronologies using these various proxies are discussed, and future research prospects are outlined.

Eleven indices of precipitation extremes are studied. The results show that regional annual total precipitation shows a significantly decreasing trend and most other precipitation indices are strongly correlated with annual total precipitation. Seasonally, a significant increase in precipitation was discovered for spring, while a decrease in precipitation was found for winter, summer, and autumn. Two significant decreasing trends are found for summer and autumn. Average consecutive dry days, number of heaviest precipitation days, very wet day precipitation, extremely wet day precipitation, maximum 1-day precipitation and simple daily intensity index show increasing trends, but only the last is statistically significant. Decreasing trends are found for consecutive wet days, wet day precipitation, number of heavy precipitation days, number of very heavy precipitation days and maximum 5-day precipitation, but only the first is significant at the 95% level. Spatial changes of precipitation extreme indices show differences, and they are not clustered. For maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation, the spatial and temporal changes in monthly precipitation are not the same. There are no significant correlations between elevation and trend magnitude of precipitation extremes. An enhanced sensitivity of precipitation extremes at higher elevations is apparent.

River entrenchment and terrace formation in the UK Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						River terraces; River incision; Holocene; Flood events; Environmental controls	VALLEY-FLOOR DEVELOPMENT; YORKSHIRE OUSE BASIN; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; FLUVIAL CHRONOLOGY; NORTH YORKSHIRE; GREAT-BRITAIN; ALLUVIAL-FAN; GLEN-FESHIE; NEW-ZEALAND; TYNE BASIN	A meta-analysis of a large database of C-14 dated fluvial units is used to assess the chronology and controls of episodic Holocene river entrenchment and terrace formation in the UK. Most Holocene terraces are of a 'fill-cut' type developed in Pleistocene sediments, in places now reaching down to pre-Holocene bedrock. Holocene terraces are widespread in higher-relief areas of the UK and peripheral higher-energy rivers, and include up to 7 levels in some valley floor reaches. Using C-14 constrained data subsets for incision episodes, the onset, vertical ranges, formation times, and rates of entrenchment are examined, together with geographical distributions. The height range of terrace separation is relatively small (0.5-3.5 m) with a long-term averaged incision rate over the late and mid-Holocene of 0.43, 0.5, 0.67, 0.7 and 0.81 m/ka in the Tweed, Rheidol, Severn, Ouse and Ribble catchments, and a regional similarity in the scale of incision events. The periods 4200-3700, 3100-2900, 2100-1900, 1800-1500 cal. BP and most notably the last 1000 years (with prominent peaks at 900-800 and 700-600 cal. BP) were times of accelerated incision. It appears likely that extreme flood events triggered the formation of incision 'slots', rather than entrenchment being a direct response to glacio-tectonic uplift, or the result of incremental valley-floor lowering by combined incision and lateral reworking. River entrenchment has also been rapid in recent centuries, reflecting the coupling of extreme-events with anthropogenic effects on catchment hydrology. Incision results in changes of river channel flood power and overbank flood extent, and improved data on the long-term and large-scale vertical tendency of UK rivers are needed for flood risk management purposes.

The results are as follows: (1) In the north, south and east of Xinjiang, the annual average maximum air temperature, annual average minimum air temperature and annual minimum air temperature all rose remarkably, while the rise of the annual maximum air temperature was not significant. (2) The rising trend of the annual average maximum air temperature was stronger in the east than in the north, and it was weakest in the south. The rising trend of annual average minimum air temperature was strongest in the east, followed by the south and the north. The annual maximum air temperature rose more strongly in the south than in the north, and the rise was weakest in the east. The change in annual minimum air temperature was higher in the south than in the east and was lowest in the north. (3) The mean values of annual average maximum temperature, annual average minimum temperature, and annual minimum temperature were highest in the south, followed by the east and north. The mean value of annual maximum temperature was highest in the east, followed by the north, and it was the lowest in the south. (4) Significant periodic variations with periods of 3-11 years appeared in the extreme air temperatures. (5) Wavelet coefficients can predict well the variation trend of extreme temperature in the future based on a significant period. These results can be applied in early warning of meteorological disasters and in realizing sustainable agricultural development in the study area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The potential of New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) for testing the synchronicity of abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial Interval (60,000-11,700 years ago)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							TREE-RINGS; RADIOCARBON CALIBRATION; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; C-14 CALIBRATION; GREENLAND ICE; SEA-LEVEL; VARIABILITY; RECORDS; SCALE	The latter part of the Last Glacial Interval (LGI; 60,000 to 11,700 years ago) experienced a range of climatic and environment extremes. To elucidate the mechanisms of these changes requires records of past variability that are precisely dated and correlated on the same absolute timescale. However, despite decades of research, it is still not possible to align most marine and terrestrial records of past change with ice-core records, largely because of ongoing uncertainties over the conversion of pre-Holocene (14)C ages on to a calendar timescale and uncertainties with in ice-core chronologies. As a result, it is equivocal whether climate changes in both hemispheres during the LGI led, lagged or were synchronous with one another. A decadally-resolved radiocarbon calibration is urgently required to test these models of the Earth system. Here we report radiocarbon measurements obtained from subfossil New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) spanning a collective 3500 years dated between 25,000 and 45,000 years ago. The results are compared to the recently published international calibration curve IntCal09 and to the marine Cariaco Basin datasets. We show that kauri have considerable potential for development of a Southern Hemisphere component of a unified global calibration curve suite, and that tree-ring sequences can be superposed on other radiocarbon records to constrain atmospheric marine offsets and precisely test the synchronicity of abrupt climate change.

We used pollen and charcoal records from a lake and a testate amoebae-derived history of water-table depth in a nearby peatland to assess the response of the jack pine-dominated forests of northwestern Wisconsin to the climate variability of the last similar to 2000 years. The hydrology record and the charcoal record indicate that the climate near Warner Lake over the last similar to 2000 years was characterized by multidecadal variation in moisture availability with no apparent multicentennial-long trends in moisture balance or fire frequency. However, the pollen record suggests that there were multicentennial-scale changes in the vegetation composition around Warner Lake. Direct comparison of the three proxy records is challenging, because of their differing temporal resolutions and the complexity of potential ecological responses to climate variability. Therefore, we developed an interpretive model to compare multiple simulated proxies under two scenarios of environmental variability in order to determine under what conditions apparently contradictory records are likely to be found. The interpretive model reveals that a record of multicentennial-long change in vegetation is possible if multidecadal climate variability interacts with ecological processes influencing the direction and magnitude of succession. Compositional changes in the Warner Lake pollen record could reflect longR term variation in temperature, seasonality or other climate factors independent of moisture balance; however it is also possible that multidecadal moisture variability interacted with ecological processes affecting recruitment and mortality of species following fires of varying size and severity. Decadal-scale climatic variability can lead to altered successional pathways and to changes in forest composition that last for centuries.

In 1995, we sampled a total of 27 wood cores from 13 Pinus lagunae trees in Sierra La Victoria (23 degrees 36'N, 109 degrees 56'W),just north of Sierra La Laguna, at an elevation of 1500-1600 m. Selected trees were locally dominant, but their ring-width patterns could not be crossdated. To test the hypothesis that visible growth layers in Pinus lagunae are formed annually, we measured radiocarbon amounts in individual rings by means of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Twenty-three C-14 measurements were used to trace the location of the 1963-64 "bomb spike" in 3 wood increment cores. By comparing the location of that Delta(14)C extreme with the number of visible radial wood increments, it was possible to conclude that 2 cores had a number of locally absent rings, while the 3rd one included a few years with more than one growth layer. Therefore, ring-width patterns of sampled Pinus lagunae were not consistent from one tree to another, most likely because of climatic regime in combination with microsite features. While the possibility of generating Pinus lagunae tree-ring chronologies cannot entirely be ruled out, the development of dendrochronological proxy records of climate from coniferous species in tropical North America should focus on species and sites that experience a more pronounced seasonality.

We employ reusable molecular-sieve cartridges and a lightweight battery-driven pumping system, developed to enable CO2 collection in difficult and dangerous terrain or under extreme climatic conditions. The results of a small field experiment suggest that CO2 could be quantitatively trapped on and recovered from the 13x molecular sieve, without any fractionation of the stable carbon isotope. The delta(13)C of CO2 was also independent of the amount of air less than or equal to 18 liters and rate at which it was collected, i.e. less than or equal to 1 liter of air/min.

In order to evaluate the geochemical mechanism of fluoride enrichment in groundwater and health implications in the Padwakodari environs of eastern part of India, a total of twenty two samples were collected and analysed for physico-chemical parameters spreading across the study area. Geologically, the area mainly comprises of phyllites, granite gneiss, mica schist and sandstone. High fluoride concentrations found mainly in the granite gneisses which are situated central to northwestern parts of the study area. The concentration of fluoride in the groundwater samples ranges from 0.3 to 11 mg/l with an average of 2 mg/l. 64% of the groundwater samples containing fluoride concentration that exceed the WHO drinking water guidelines value of 1.5 mg/l. Chronic ingestion of high doses has been linked to the development of dental fluorosis, and in extreme cases, skeletal fluorosis. The dominant geochemical facies present in water are Na-Ca-Mg-HCO3 (11 samples), Na-Mg-Ca-HCO3 (5 samples), Ca-Na-Mg-HCO3 (5 samples) and Ca-Mg-Na-HCO3 (1 sample). Sodium and bicarbonate ions being major component in majority of the water types (located mostly in the granite gneiss formation) has a tendency to increase fluoride concentration in groundwater by dissolving the fluoride from fluoride bearing minerals. The oversaturation of half of the samples with respect to calcite and majority of samples undersaturation with respect to fluorite makes it feasible for fluoride to get released in to the groundwater. Decreasing Ca activity downgradient (recharge to discharge) leads to a dominance of fluorite-unsaturated conditions and consequently to mobilization of fluoride in groundwater. The results indicate that the fluoride concentration in groundwater is mainly governed by high weathering of fluoride bearing minerals (i.e. apatite and biotite) in granite gneiss contains abundant fluoride, alkaline hydrogeological environment, high temperature, low rainfall, evapotranspiration and ion exchange.

The most commonly used drought index, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), was used to represent the drought conditions in the study region. We first calculated the Loess Plateau PDSI using monthly temperature and precipitation from 53 meteorological stations and then determined trends in the PDSI, temperature, and precipitation using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) time series analysis method. Because of the different change characteristics and trends, precipitation plays an important role in the interannual variation in the PDSI, while temperature drives the PDSI trend change. The differences between the observed PDSI and the calculated results using the detrended temperature and observed precipitation, the observed temperature and detrended precipitation, and the detrended temperature and precipitation indicate that impact of the precipitation trend on droughts is smaller than the impact of the temperature trend. The increase in the observed temperature and limited decrease in the precipitation tend to increase drought in the Loess Plateau. The Loess Plateau will become drier and warmer in the future under climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Intensified monsoon and spatiotemporal changes in precipitation patterns in the NW Himalaya during the early-mid Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							RADIOCARBON AGE CALIBRATION; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; BASIN WESTERN TIBET; UPPER SPITI VALLEY; INDIAN MONSOON; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION; ABRUPT CHANGES; COLD EVENTS; CLIMATE	We have undertaken a high resolution palaeoclimate reconstruction on radiocarbon dated palaeolake sediments from the Spiti valley, NW Himalaya. This site lies in the climatically sensitive winter westerlies and Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) transitional regime and provides an opportunity to reconstruct the precipitation seasonality, and extreme precipitation events that are characterised by intensified erosion. The lake sediments reveal distinct lithofacies that provide evidence of changes in depositional environment and climate during early to mid Holocene (8.7-6.1 cal ka BP). We have identified three stages during the period of lake's existence: the Stage I (8.7-7.6 cal ka BP) is marked by lake establishment; Stage II (similar to 7.6-6.8 cal ka BP) by sustained cooler periods and weakened summer monsoon, and Stage III (similar to 6.8-6.1 cal ka BP) by a shift from colder to warmer climate with stronger ISM. We have identified several short term cooler periods at ca. 8.7, 8.5, 8.3 and 7.2-6.9 cal ka BP. Based on an overview of regional climate records we show that there is an abrupt switch in precipitation seasonality ca. 6.8 cal ka BP that is followed by the onset of the intensified monsoon in the NW Himalaya.

Mid-Holocene occupation of the Dry Puna in NW Argentina: Evidence from the Hornillos 2 rockshelter	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							JUJUY; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE	This paper summarizes the results of the research carried out during a decade at the Hornillos 2 rockshelter, located at 4020 m asl in the Dry Puna of Argentina. The human occupations in this site are bracketed between the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary and the mid-Holocene, challenging the idea of a widespread abandonment of the Andes highlands during mid-Holocene due to extreme arid conditions (i.e. the "silencio arqueologico" or archaeological silence hypothesis). Nine occupational levels have been recognized in the timed span at the site, the result of hunter gatherer activities carried out in a highly oscillating and changing environment. Here we present the mean trends and patterns observed in the full set of lines of inquiry applied in the site: lithic evidence, zooarchaeological analysis, rock art, stratigraphic and spatial analysis, and isotopic data. The outcomes of these studies, together with the site location features, known raw materials sources and regional archaeological evidence, indicate that hunter gatherer groups reduced their residential mobility, and increased the intensity of their occupations and the rate of technological innovations in the arid and unstable mid-Holocene landscapes.

Specifically, the impacts of the contemporary vegetation at the study sites are analysed with regard to viewshed areas and views from the monument locations. Results show that while GIS-based viewshed analysis is useful for quantifying the absolute upper and lower limits for viewshed area, the virtual reality reconstructions allow the possibilities in between these extremes to be explored. In addition, VR provides the opportunity to explore visually rich representations of past environments for site interpretation and it is also a useful way for presenting uncertainty and testing different scenarios for landscape archaeology context.

Radiocarbon dates for the tops of buried palaeosols indicate that reworking of sediment locally predates 5.9-5.6 cal. ka BP, and has been intermittently active throughout the late Holocene. Broad coincidences of timing are evident for the onset of reworking of different sectors of the talus slope at c. 5.9-5.6 cal. ka BP, c. 2.3-1.7 cal. ka BP and c. 0.7-0.5 cal. ka BP, that may represent more widespread reworking. Analysis of subfossil palynomorphs within some buried palaeosols suggests that most reworking postdates the main period of local, anthropogenic woodland clearance dated to the mid-Holocene. Buried palaeosols examined contain no evidence of local burning of vegetation. These findings appear to exclude anthropogenic interference with vegetation as a possible cause of late-Holocene erosion of this talus. Evidence for alternative causes of reworking is largely inferential. One hypothesis is that the timing of phases of reworking may reflect the occurrence of climatic events of sufficient magnitude to induce talus slope failure (extreme events). If so, an implication of this finding is that talus deposits may be highly sensitive to climate and could ultimately yield a proxy-record of extreme event occurrence.

Analysis of leporid remains from 14 Padre (AD 1070-1150) and Elden (AD 1150-1220) phase sites indicates that the prehistoric inhabitants of the region relied heavily on both jackrabbits and cottontails. The bones are well preserved, and tend to be relatively complete and unfragmented. Body part frequencies and bone damage in the Sinagua assemblages are very different from patterns observed in samples from sites in the Great Basin and the Hohokam area of central and southern Arizona. Both of these latter areas seem to have witnessed much more intensive processing of leporids. The less intensive processing of the bones suggests that the Sinagua did not suffer from the extreme dietary stress that has been proposed for the Hohokam. The leporid index, which measures the relative proportions of cottontails and jackrabbits, indicates that the Sinagua assemblages tend to be dominated by jackrabbits. This contrasts with findings from other sites excavated in the northern Arizona area. The predominance of jackrabbits does not seem to be solely a function of environmental factors: and may reflect a garden hunting strategy. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

However, there is scant documentation of droughts in southern South America, particularly from the Pampas, and none based on the geological record. In this article, we provide clear evidence of aeolian reactivation and sand deposition in some areas of La Pampa and San Luis provinces, western Pampas (Argentina), during early-mid 20th century in response to drier conditions, probably amplified, like historic droughts in North America, by anthropogenic factors (e.g. significant population increase and agriculture expansion into a fragile environment). Evidence includes widespread bare sand blowouts, extensive surfaces with active sand migration, steep dune lee slopes, and sharp crests covered by weak soil development (A/C profile), accompanied by historical documents. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages on aeolian beds confirm mobilization and sedimentation by wind processes c. 95-60 yr BP. Considering the dominant (over 70%) austral spring-summer precipitation, it is possible the rainfall deficit in western Pampas was linked to positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the western subtropical South Atlantic Ocean (20-30 degrees S and 30-50 degrees W), according to significant canonical correlation between the precipitation field in subtropical South America and the Atlantic Ocean SST anomalies.

KARST.; PICEA-ABIES; TREE-RING; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; TATRA MOUNTAINS; SCOTS PINE; DENDROCHRONOLOGY; RESPONSES; PROGRAM; SERIES	Norway spruce trees grown outside their natural range were intensively studied in terms of their adaptability to increased late winter temperature. A total of 708 cores of Norway spruce were taken from 35 sites throughout northwestern and western Poland at sites outside or at the margin of its natural range. Clustering reveals that research sites are grouped geographically. The mean ring widths, however, are similar among the three regions. The relationships between tree growth and temperature together with precipitation are comparable to those in lower elevations in Central and Eastern Europe and southern latitudes in Scandinavia. In total, 18% of the single correlations for all months were significant at p < 0.05. The generally positive precipitation effect was found for all months except January. Temperature had mixed effects on ring width. Higher temperatures in late winter and early spring increased ring width (13% of all significant correlations). High summer temperatures in both the previous and the current year, on the other hand, generally had a negative impact on tree-ring width during the growing season. On most of the sites, the observed long-term trend for increasing temperatures in February and March had no significant negative influence on tree growth. Also the effect of extreme weather events was taken into account. In 1994 and 1995 the wider rings were mostly observed in humid sites from southwestern Poland. In selected time spans, growth recovery following extreme weather events is particularly strong. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Hence, understanding of observed and projected changes in river discharge is of utmost importance. In the present contribution, results of studies devoted to observations (hydrological networks) and model-based projections of discharge in large rivers in Asia are presented. Even if changes in some observation records can be detected, their attribution is not easy, because the process of river discharge results from multiple factors. Hence, climatic background (observed and modelled changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, snow cover and glaciers), and non-climatic factors (demography, socio-economy, withdrawals) play a role. Changes in river discharge extremes (high and low flows) are particularly important. Changes in discharges of large Asian rivers are of primary concern to the pursuit of sustainable development in the region. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

One of the caves had been used as a community burial chamber from ca. 400 BC to 50 AD. Inside, approximately 30 naturally mummified bodies rested in bed-like wooden coffins exhibiting ornamental carving and elaborate painting. The dead had been furnished with a rich store of grave goods consisting of both personal ornaments and objects of daily life as well as the remains of domestic animals. Due to the favourable climatic conditions, all of the artefacts, which also include fur and textile garments, are in a surprisingly good state of preservation. The anthropological analysis shows that the group's demographic structure is balanced, and that the individuals exhibit morphometric affinities to Mongolian populations. Within the highly homogenous group, shared morphological patterns characterize three-possibly familial-subgroups. There is evidence of successful surgical treatment, implying considerable medical knowledge. The general state of health shows the individuals to have been well adapted to their extreme environment on the edge of human habitation. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High-altitude adaptation and late Pleistocene foraging in the Bolivian Andes	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Andes; Highlands; Hunter-gatherers; Mobility; Paleoindian	ARCHAEOLOGICAL RADIOCARBON DATABASE; ATACAMA DESERT; HUMAN OCCUPATION; HYPERARID CORE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIBETAN; CHILE; COLONIZATION; CHRONOLOGY; SETTLEMENT	The high Andes of South America were among the last environments that Homo sapiens colonized during its Pleistocene dispersion out of Africa. The peopling of this high-elevation environment was constrained by atmospheric hypoxia, cold stress, and resource availability. Here we report archaeological and geoarchaeological analyses from Cueva Bautista, a dry rock shelter, located at 3933 m above sea level in southwestern Bolivia. We focus on a well-preserved occupation surface containing hearths and high-quality stone tools AMS dated to 12,700-12,100 cal BP. Geoarchaeological resolution of the site supports its stratigraphic integrity and archaeological analyses indicate that the early human occupation was formed as a temporary camp by mobile foragers relying on a curated technological strategy. Regional paleoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that Cueva Bautista's occupation was synchronous with humid conditions and its abandonment with increased aridity. Our findings suggest that mobile hunter-gatherers explored - albeit not colonized - the high Andes during the late Pleistocene and provides further support that a combination of biological, behavioral, and environmental constraints affected human adaptation to this extreme environment.

The results are as follows. (1) The extreme cold and warm indices exhibited contrasting variation trends over the entire region: the cold indices (TX10, TN10, ID, FD and CSDI) decreased; the warm indices (TX90, TN90, SU, TR and WSDI) increased; the extremal indices (TXn, TNn, TXx and TXn) increased; and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) decreased. (2) The absolute indices, extremal indices and other indices showed a certain latitudinal zonality: ice days (ID) and frost days (FD) decreased from north to south, while summer days (SU), tropical nights (TR), extremal indices (TXn, TNn, TXx and TXn), the cold and warm spell duration indicators (CSDI and WSDI, respectively) and growing season length (GSL) increased from north to south. (3) The correlation analysis results showed that, except for the extremal indices and individual indices, the extreme temperature indices correlated well. (4) The altitude has a large impact on spatial distribution of extreme temperature indices, and the ubiquity of the heat island effect in urban constructed regions also had an impact on amplitude of variation in extreme temperature.

Decreases of ice days and the number of frost days were statistically significant, but a decreasing trend of the diurnal temperature range was not significant. At a large proportion of the stations, patterns of temperature extremes were consistent with warming since 1960. Warming trends in minimum temperature indices were greater than those relating to maximum temperature. Warming magnitudes were greater on the southern and northern Shanxi Loess Plateau, the eastern Gansu Loess Plateau, and the Erdos Plateau than on the middle part of the eastern Shanxi Loess Plateau, the northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau and the Guanzhong Plain, as confirmed by the decrease of the regional trend from north to south. Changes in precipitation extremes were relatively small, and only the regional trends in consecutive dry days and simple daily intensity index were significant. These trends were difficult to detect against the larger inter-annual and decadal-scale variability of precipitation. On the whole, the number of rainy days increased on the northern Loess Plateau, but the extreme precipitation events had decreased in the whole region. The spatial distribution of temporal changes of all extreme climate indices in Loess Plateau reflects the general climatic complexity and the influence of topography. Analysis of large-scale atmospheric circulation changes revealed that a strengthening anticyclonic circulation, increasing geopotential height, weakening monsoonal flow, and vapor transportation over the Eurasian continent have contributed to the changes of climate extremes in the Loess Plateau.

Since then, the climate has continued undergoing major variations. The succession of climatic episodes, humid or dry, is pointed out along with the episodes' complex interactions. These variations are placed in parallel to cultural phases of evolution in archaeology and history. Climate-related events have always had heavy consequences on the peopling of this vast region, often subject to extreme natural conditions. The relative synchronism between the principal cultural trends from west to east across the Sahel seems to have often been subject to swings in the climate and the resulting environmental changes.

We here generate idealized climate events using palaeoclimate records. In a mathematical model of regional sociocultural development, these events disturb the subsistence base of simulated forager and farmer societies. We evaluate the regional simulated transition timings and durations against a published large set of radiocarbon dates for western Eurasia; the model is able to realistically hindcast much of the inhomogeneous space-time evolution of regional Neolithic transitions. Our study shows that the consideration of climate events improves the simulation of typical lags between cultural complexes, but that the overall difference to a model without climate events is not significant. Climate events may not have been as important for early sociocultural dynamics as endogenous factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These patterns, such as imbrication, indicate certain transport processes, mostly as to direction and character. Many years of observation and measuring of coarse coastal deposits, are the basis for the conclusions presented here on environmental transport processes, their character, and their energy. Beside imbrication, special emphasis is given to unstable or delicate settings of large boulders that evidently have remained in these positions from hundreds to thousands of years. This deserves an explanation to how they arrived at these positions, and why they have not changed into a more stable position, given an environment of constant energy input along coastlines. The discussion lays emphasis on whether both settings of (mega-) boulders can be indicative of tsunami transport processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

At least two episodes of inundation are recognized, the first occurring at c. 7200-5700 cal. yr BP and a second from c. 4700 cal. yr BP. The first involved increasing salinity of surface waters, likely associated with marine intrusion linked to post-glacial sea-level change (meltwater pulse (MWP) 2). The second appears to have been freshwater in nature and driven at least in part by extreme meteorological events of high levels of precipitation in combination with impeded drainage. These two episodes had profound impacts on Neolithic settlement and farming. Further hydrological changes, presumably linked to changes in sedimentary regime, geomorphology and drainage of the Taihu depression, recorded at the Chuodun site after c. 3000 cal. yr BP, appear to have had a major effect on technologically relatively advanced food production systems. While environmental pressures appear to have played an important role in shaping human activities and settlement on the southern Yangtze Delta, people responded by adopting strategies that included an increased reliance on food production, migration to more clement locations and implementation of new technologies, which possibly included the construction of flood defence works.

This Al-Andalus civilization generated a large amount of documentation during those centuries. Unfortunately, most of the documents are lost. The surviving Arabic documentary sources have never been studied from a climate perspective. In this paper, we present the first attempt to retrieve climate evidence from them. We studied all the Islamic chronicles (documents written by Islamic historians that narrate the social, political and religious history) available for the period ad 711-1010. It is shown that these sources recorded extreme events with a high temporal and spatial resolution. We identified three severe droughts, ad 748-754, ad 812-823 and ad 867-879, affecting Al-Andalus. We also noticed that the weather in Cordoba during the period ad 971-975 showed a higher frequency of snow and hail than current climate. The possibility of obtaining long continuous series from this type of source seems highly difficult.

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to examine the pollen-climate relationships, and mean summer precipitation (MSP) and mean January temperature (MJaT) were inferred to be the first and second important factors controlling the spatial distribution of the surface pollen in the study area. The original dataset was screened with CCA for MSP and MJaT separately to detect anomalous samples that show the extreme values. The first screened dataset was established after excluding those anomalous samples, and the initial transfer function was generated using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WAPLS) method. The jackknife test was then applied to the WAPLS model for determining the optimum transfer function and for detecting large-residual samples, and the final transfer function was generated after removing the large-residual samples from the first screened dataset. The final dataset for MSP and MJaT consists of 428 and 419 samples, respectively. The root mean square errors of prediction for both WAPLS models are 34 mm and 2.7 degrees C, and the coefficients of determination are 0.85 and 0.73. This study suggests that the values of climatic parameters could be better estimated and the reliability of pollen-climate transfer functions would be significantly improved through removing anomalous and large-residual samples from the original dataset with mathematical methods.

Twenty-first century central Rocky Mountain river discharge scenarios under greenhouse forcing	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Pacific Climate WorkshopProceedings of the 25th Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM)	MAR 06-09, 2011MAR 06-09, 2011	Pacific Grove, CAPacific Grove, CA				CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; SCALE CIRCULATION; EL-NINO; NORTH; IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; PACIFIC; CANADA	The present-day hydroclimatology of the central Rocky Mountains is heavily influenced by recurring large-scale climate patterns: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO). Hence, low frequency central Rocky Mountain river discharge variability can be successfully modeled by regression techniques using these climate indices as predictors. Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression equations captured a large portion of streamflow variability at the hydrological apex of North America. Using archived runs from global climate models from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - CMIP3), the PDO, ENSO and the NAO were projected for the 21st century for the B1, A1B and A2 Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). These projected climate indices were used as inputs into the GLS regression equations, giving projected central Rocky Mountains river discharges. These projections showed generally declining trends in central Rocky Mountains surface water availability for 2006-2050 and 2006-2096. This study's novel result is that projection distribution functions show a shift in the variance of the flows, from a relatively symmetric equal probability of low versus high flows about the mode and mean in 2006, to a broader, left-skewed flow pattern with a higher probability of low flows in general, and extreme low flows in particular, by 2096.

In this study, four tree ring-width chronologies were developed based on lived Qilian Juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) trees in the southeast Qilian Mountains, China. The four chronologies were developed from 164 cores (82 trees) for the northern marginal of the Asian summer monsoon in China. Tree growth of this area is sensitive to moisture variability of the growth season. During the last 260 years, there had been extreme growth depressions in the years 1877-1878 and 1928, indicating large-scale droughts had occurred in the study area. These extreme drought events had a devastating effect not only on hydrology and agriculture, but also on society and economics. Extreme droughts in 1877-1878 and in 1928 occurring in the study region and most of China were triggered by different climate regimes. The former drought distribution pattern was probably attributable to El Nifio events, while the latter was associated with warm and cold air masses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

We present a record of changes in vegetation over the past 17,000 years, from a lake in extreme southern Chile (Isla Santa Ines, Magallanes region, 53 degrees 38.97S; 72 degrees 25.24W), where human influence on vegetation is negligible. The western archipelago of Tierra del Fuego remained treeless for most of the Lateglacial period; Lycopodium magellanicum, Gunnera magellanica and heath species dominated the vegetation. Nothofagus may have survived the last glacial maximum at the eastern edge of the Magellan glaciers from where it spread southwestwards and established in the region at around 10,500 cal. yr BP. Nothofagus antarctica was likely the earlier colonizing tree in the western islands, followed shortly after by Nothofagus betuloides. At 9000 cal. yr BP moorland communities expanded at the expense of Nothofagus woodland. Simultaneously, Nothofagus species shifted to dominance of the evergreen Nothofagus betuloides and the Magellanic rain forest established in the region. Rapid and drastic vegetation changes occurred at 5200 cal. yr BP, after the Mt Burney MB2 eruption, including the expansion and establishment of Pilgerodendron uviferum and the development of mixed Nothofagus-Pilgerodendron-Drimys woodland. Scattered populations of Nothofagus, as they occur today in westernmost Tierra del Fuego may be a good analogue for Nothofagus populations during the Lateglacial in eastern sites.

Up to date, presence of this species has been identified at 25 sites. A comprehensive study of Iberian woolly mammoths from an anatomical, chronological, palaeogeographical and palaeoecological perspectives is here presented. New descriptions of a number of fossils are also included. The Iberian woolly mammoth remains do not differ morphometrically from individuals of contemporaneous populations from other parts of Europe, compared with an extensive sample mainly from the North Sea and also from other continental European localities. Earliest presence of woolly mammoth in the Iberian Peninsula has been imprecisely dated between late Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene, although most correspond to MIS 3 and 2 stages, coinciding with periods of extreme dry and cold climatic conditions documented in terrestrial and marine sediment sequences. The geographical distribution reached the southern latitude of Padul (at 37 degrees N), which constitutes the southernmost European occurrence of this species. Nevertheless, most of the occurrences are located in the north of the peninsula (Cantabrian area and Catalonia). Statistical analysis on the ecological composition of fossil assemblages with presence of M. primigenius show that temperate ungulate species are predominant at Iberian assemblages, resulting in a particular mixture of temperate and cold elements which does not reflect the typical faunal composition of the Eurasian mammoth steppe. This particular situation supports the idea that woolly mammoth only reached the peninsula occasionally, during the Pleistocene coldest episodes, resulting in a mixing of cold and temperate faunas, instead a faunal replacement.

We hypothesize that the world's largest Alpine arid ecosystem however, the Alpine Steppes of the Tibetan highlands, remained ecologically stable during the LGM and the mid-Holocene. This hypothesis is tested by distributional range of plant species, plant life forms and rate of endemism. The set of character species has a precipitation gradient between 50 and 350 mm/a, testifying for resilience to precipitation changes. 83% of the species have a wider vertical range than 1000 m used as a proxy for resilience to temperature changes. 30% of the species are endemic with 10 endemic genera, including plate-shaped cushions as a unique plant life form. These findings are in line with palaeo-ecological proxies (delta O-18, pollen) allowing the assumption that Alpine Steppes persisted during the LGM with 3 to 4 K lower summer temperatures. During the mid-Holocene, forests could have replaced Alpine Steppes in the upper catchments of the Huang He, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Yarlung Zhangbo, but not in the interior basins of the north-western highlands, because the basins were then flooded, suppressing forests and supporting the environmental stability of this arid Alpine grassland biome.

However. Reg soils in the hyperarid southern Negev and Namib deserts are distinctly different. Soils developed on stable alluvial surfaces with only direct input of rainfall and dust depend heavily on rainfall characteristics. Annual rainfall amount can be similar (15-30 mm), but storm duration can drastically alter Reg soil properties in deserts. The cooler fall/winter and dry hot summers of the southern Negev Desert with a predominance brief day) rainstorms result in gypsic-saline soils without any calcic soil horizon. Although the Namib Desert receives only 50-60% of the southern Negev annual rainfall, its rainstorm duration is commonly 2-4 days. This improves leaching of the top soil under even lower annual rainfall amount and results in weeks-long grass cover. The long-term cumulative effect of these rare rain-grass relationships produces a calcic-gypsic-saline soil. The development of these different kinds of desert soils highlights the importance of daily to seasonal rainfall characteristics in influencing soil-moisture regime in deserts, and has important implications for the use of key desert soil properties as proxies in paleoclimatology.

Not that long ago the only evidence of human presence here was the Berelekh site in the lower reaches of the Indighirka River. This landmark dates to 13,000-12,000 years ago but it was widely accepted as documentation of the earliest stage of human dispersal in the Arctic. New research discussed here, shows that humans began colonizing the Siberian Arctic at least by the end of the early stage of MIS 3 at around 45,000 years ago. For now, this earliest known stage of human occupation in the arctic regions is documented by the evidence of human hunting. The archaeological record of continued human occupation is fragmentary; nevertheless, evidence exists for each significant phase including the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Siberian Arctic human populations were likely supported by the local mammoth population, which provided humans with food and raw material in the form of mammoth tusks. Processing of mammoth ivory is recognized widely as one of the most important peculiarities of the material culture of ancient humans. In fact, ivory tool manufacturing is one of the most important innovations of the Upper Palaeolithic in northern Eurasia. Technology that allowed manufacturing of long ivory shafts long points and full-size spears was critical in the tree-less open landscapes of Eurasian mammoth steppe belt. These technological skills reach their greatest extent and development shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum but are recognizable until the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary across Northern Eurasia in all areas populated by mammoths and humans. Loss of this stable source of raw material due to the late Pleistocene mammoth extinction may have provoked a shift in post-LGM Siberia to the Beringian microblade tradition. This paper reviews the most important archaeological findings made in arctic Siberia over the last twenty years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The glacial relief of the massif offers an abundance of topographic depressions (cirque overdeepenings, morainic closed depressions) where sedimentary sequences may potentially reveal paleoenvironmental changes that may have occurred since the glaciers' retreat from the Last Glacial Maximum position (similar to 26-18 ka). We present a review of Late Glacial and Holocene sedimentary archives from the Tatra Mountains collected in the Polish and non-Polish literature. The data sets (40 sites) included 21 lake, 13 peat bog, and 6 colluvial sediment sites. The entire listed sediment sequence features radiometric datings or at the very least a chronological framework is inferred from the biostratigraphy. The oldest sampled sedimentary sequences were dated back to the Oldest Dryas and were obtained from the deepest glacial lakes located in the subalpine zone (up to 1700 m). Shallow lakes (<10 m) and morainic closed depressions do not reveal sediments older than the Holocene. This can be linked with dry climate conditions and unfavorable hydrologic regimes during the Late Glacial when the studied depressions remained dry over the long term following deglaciation, irrespective of elevation and position in the glaciated valley system. For the Holocene, several millennial-scale phases of climate humidity and increased debris flow activity were identified. The intensification of debris flows is indicated at 9-7.5 ka and during the mid-to late Holocene (at ca. 6 ka, 3.5 ka, 2 ka, after 300 AD, 800-1000 AD, and LIA), separated by relatively stable climate conditions during the 'Holocene thermal optimum' (7.5-6 ka). The LIA in the Tatra Mountains was a relatively long (1220-1925 AD) and climatically unstable period, with a cold and dry first phase (1220-1540 AD), followed by a cold and humid phase (1540-1925 AD). During the modern warm period, renewed intensification of extreme slope processes has been recorded after 1970 AD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Current knowledge of long-term regional precipitation variability is scarce due to spatially and temporally limited weather and high-resolution proxy climate records. We developed the first boreal spring precipitation reconstruction for the western Himalaya covering the last millennium (1030-2011 C.E.). The annually resolved reconstruction is based on a large tree-ring data set of Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) and neoza pine (Pinus gerardiana) from 16 ecologically homogeneous moisture stressed settings in Kinnaur, western Indian Himalaya. The precipitation reconstruction revealed persistent long-term spring droughts from the 12th to early 16th century C.E. and pluvial from the late 16th century C.E. to recent decades. The late 15th and early 16th centuries (1490-1514 C.E.) displayed the driest episode, with precipitation being similar to 15% lower than the long-term mean. The early 19th century (1820-1844 C.E.) was the wettest period of the past millennium, with mean precipitation similar to 13% above the long-term mean. The reconstructed boreal spring precipitation from the western Himalaya revealed large-scale consistency with hydrological records from westerly dominated regions in Central Asia, indicating synoptic-scale changes in atmospheric circulation during the major part of the Medieval and Little Ice Age periods. Protracted droughts in Central Asia could have caused severe contraction of the regional economy, as indicated by striking coherence of reconstructed drought periods and historic social upheavals and invasions of India from Central and Western Asian invaders. Vulnerability to climatic extremes underpins the need to develop a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in regional hydroclimate in order to devise viable water resource management plans.

Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the main driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in the whole YRB. To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) in the YRB using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream stations and 17 tributary stations). The Mann-Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72% of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0.1 significance level) and 22% of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes in the YRB. According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the collapse of check dams caused by extreme storms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

In the last 10 years, the use of 3D technologies for the documentation of tangible cultural heritage has changed the way to approach archaeological intra-site survey. These technologies allow for the reproduction of 3D replicas of sites and monuments and have proven to be a powerful tool for the documentation and preservation of the archaeological record. However, the full integration of 3D technologies in archaeological field methods requires the definition of best documentation practices and methods of accurate assessment of the acquired data. In fact, although the use of 3D laser scanners, computer vision and photogrammetric methods is now well established, there are no convincing quantitative comparisons between laser scanning and image-based modelling techniques for the acquisition of archaeological stratigraphy in extreme environmental and lighting conditions. In this sense the 3D documentation of the archaeological site of Las Cuevas, Belize, represented an important opportunity to test and compare phase shift variation laser scanning and image-based modelling techniques in an environment characterized by very high humidity and variability in lighting. This study compared both the accuracy and density reliability of 3D models showing how the different 3D documentation techniques can be integrated for the recording of the excavation process. The research presented in this paper provides an accurate data assessment representing a concrete starting point for the definition of a sharable and overall methodology that will help to define best 3D practices for the documentation of archaeological sites.

Most precipitation indices do not exhibit consistent or statistically significant trends across the region. Regionally averaged total precipitation, consecutive dry days (CDD), heavy precipitation days (R10) and simple daily intensity index (SDII) have increased, but only consecutive dry days (CDD) are statistically significant. At the same time, there has been an insignificant decrease in regionally averaged very heavy precipitation days (R20), extremely heavy precipitation days (R25), consecutive wet days (CWD), very wet days (R95p) and extremely wet days (R99p), maximum 1-day precipitation amount (Rx1day), maximum 5-days precipitation amount (Rx5days) and Wet days (NW). The distribution of positive and negative slopes in the area is extremely irregular. The spatial and temporal distributions of indices of climate extremes in monthly precipitation extremes show differences. In addition, there were significant correlations between annual total precipitation and precipitation extremes, except consecutive dry days. Change of most extreme precipitation indices is affected by the South Asia summer monsoon (SASM) evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The abrupt change and the period in AI and ET0 were characterized using a comprehensive time series analysis conducted with Mann-Kendall test and Morlet wavelet. The results indicated that the regionally averaged value of AI significantly decreased by 0.04/decade during 1960-2012 period, with the maximum observed in 1972. Similarly, the regional trend for ET0 was at the rate of -9.6 mm/decade with statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Most of these stations with positive value for AI were primarily distributed at the northern southwestern TP. Moreover, a majority of stations with low values of ET0 were substantially distributed at the central and eastern TP, and amounts of the stations with high values of ET0 were mainly located at a lower elevation. Abrupt changes of both AI and ET0 primarily happened in 1980s. The major cycles of AI and ET0 were 15 y and 17 y scale over the study period with apparent periodic oscillation characteristics, respectively, and together with other different scale cycles co-existing. The significant correlations between AI and East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) indicated that AI over the TP was related to the EASMI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Urban geoarchaeology is focused on site accumulation, collapse, weathering and erosion, as constrained by architectural plans and structures. These may document settlement growth and decay, as well as environmental history, posing a multidisciplinary challenge of interactive and fluctuating processes. Part of a World Heritage site, the Lost City of the Pyramids (Heit el-Ghurab), at the desert and floodplain margins of Giza, was centered on a Workmen's Town that channeled the roles of seasonal workmen, artisans, and administrators during construction of the Menkaure Pyramid and preparation of the funerary cult for that pharaoh (similar to 2532-2503 BCE). Built across a normally dry wadi course, the site was badly chosen and vulnerable to a coeval high-amplitude precipitation anomaly of perhaps 120 yr, during which mudbrick meltdown, catastrophic flash floods, and mass-movements destroyed the royal complex of mudbrick galleries, workshops and bread-making kilns once every 4 years or so. In addition, thick alluvial fans advanced 1 km or more across the Nile floodplain, before dissection was initiated by downcutting channels. Despite this dynamic environmental history, the site was repeatedly rebuilt and ruined, with structural and human consequences. This Old Kingdom (Dynasty 4) paleoclimatic anomaly did not however support a significant improvement of Saharan ecology, and summer monsoonal rains never extended this far north (30 degrees N). Such a destructive period of extreme precipitation is novel for the Holocene record of the NE Sahara, and requires a synoptic explanation in the mid-latitude jet stream, rather than the tropical monsoonal circulation, to contradict current theoretical expectations. This anomaly was repeated on a subdued scale during the Early Middle Ages. Nile floods did not impinge upon the site during Old Kingdom times, but were demonstrably higher similar to 700 BCE, and again during Early Roman or Coptic times. Residual subdisciplinary problems are identified and explicitly discussed in terms of the strategies and structure of multidisciplinary investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regional extreme dry years (<25D) were found in 1451, 1455, 1480, 1488, 1490, 1591, 1649, 1770, 1776, 1824, 1831, 1879, 1922, 1927 and 1992, while extreme wet years (>= 25D) were not observed. Persistent decadal dry intervals were observed in the 1450s, 1480s, 1510s, 1580s-90s, 1680s-1720s, 1820s-40s, 1920s-30s and after 1990s, and decadal wet intervals in the 1410s, 1500s, 1540s-50s, 1610s-70s, 1750s-60s, 1790s-1800s, 1880s-1910s, 1960s-80s. Regional droughts evident in the reconstruction appear to be relatively consistent with the drought history of the entire arid northeastern TP to the north indicated by previous studies. Spectral peaks of 2.1-5.9 years may be indicative of ENSO and IOD activity, as also suggested by negative correlations with SSTs in the eastern equatorial and southeastern Pacific Ocean and the northern Indian Ocean. Significant multi-decadal spectral peaks of 31.1-36.6 years and 41-53.8 years were identified and indicated that the decadal-scale variability may be linked to SST variations in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Through the use of high-resolution last deglaciation pollen records from the continental slope off Senegal, our data show that one of the longest and most extreme droughts in the western Sahel history, which occurred during the North Atlantic Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), displayed a succession of three major phases. These phases progressed from an interval of maximum pollen representation of Saharan elements between similar to 19 and 17.4 kyr BP indicating the onset of aridity and intensified NE trade winds, followed by a millennial interlude of reduced input of Saharan pollen and increased input of Sahelian pollen, to a final phase between similar to 16.2 and 15 kyr BP that was characterized by a second maximum of Saharan pollen abundances. This change in the pollen assemblage indicates a mid-HS1 interlude of NE trade wind relaxation, occurring between two distinct trade wind maxima, along with an intensified mid-tropospheric African Easterly Jet (AEJ) indicating a substantial change in West African atmospheric processes. The pollen data thus suggest that although the NE trades have weakened, the Sahel drought remained severe during this time interval. Therefore, a simple strengthening of trade winds and a southward shift of the West African monsoon trough alone cannot fully explain millennial-scale Sahel droughts during periods of AMOC weakening. Instead, we suggest that an intensification of the AEJ is needed to explain the persistence of the drought during HS1. Simulations with the Community Climate System Model indicate that an intensified AEJ during periods of reduced AMOC affected the North African climate by enhancing moisture divergence over the West African realm, thereby extending the Sahel drought for about 4000 years.

The article outlines how this multidisciplinary method can provide insights into the success and failures of an archaeological site, in this case the Maya site of Palenque. We also detail convincing evidence that shows that the Maya of Palenque did not leave their city because of deficiencies of water, as some paleoclimatologists and archaeologists have asserted. The first logical step toward understanding any settlement's water system is to use basic hydrologic methods and theory and to understand the local watershed. There is great potential for watershed-climate modeling in developing plausible scenarios of water use and supply and of the effect of extreme conditions (flood and drought), all of which cannot be fully represented by atmosphere-based climate and weather projections. The research demonstrates how the local watershed, land-use, and ecological conditions interact with regional climate changes. The archaeological implications for this noninvasive "virtual" method are many, including detecting periods of stress within a community, estimating population by developing caps based on the availability of water and understanding settlement patterns, as well as assisting present local populations in understanding their water cycle.

To date, flood sequences in the UK have been analysed using upland boulder berms, vertically accreting fills in contracting channels, cutoff fills and flood basin deposits. These cover different timespans ranging from c. 100-300 yr (berms and channel fills) to a limited set of the most extreme of Holocene events. Collation of future site data may allow record splicing to generate longer or more continuous series. Other sequences are potentially available from alternative depositional environments, including lateral accretion deposits, slackwater sediments in bedrock channels and palaeochannels. However, these have not produced UK results as yet, and there are reasons for them being less useful in this environment than has proved to be the case elsewhere. Finally, a new approach to overbank sedimentation sequences is presented. Analysing such deposits in much greater detail than hitherto gives flood series on a millennial timescale, and it is suggested that the prevalence of such sediments on UK floodplains may allow longer and more complete flood series data to be obtained than has otherwise been possible.

However, there are relatively few methods to quantitatively reconstruct palaeoprecipitation and river discharge compared with proxies of other climatic factors, such as temperature. We developed autoregressive and least squares statistical models relating Chesapeake Bay salinity to river discharge and regional precipitation records. Salinity in northern and central parts of the modern Chesapeake Bay is influenced largely by seasonal, interannual and decadal variations in Susquehanna River discharge, which in turn are controlled by regional precipitation patterns. A power regressive discharge model and linear precipitation model exhibit well- defined decadal variations in peak discharge and precipitation. The utility of the models was tested by estimating Holocene palaeoprecipitation and Susquehanna River palaeodischarge, as indicated by isotopically derived palaeosalinity reconstructions from Chesapeake Bay sediment cores. Model results indicate that the early - mid Holocene ( 7055 - 5900 yr BP) was drier than the late Holocene ( 1500 yr BP - present), the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' (MWP) ( 1200 - 600 yr BP) was drier than the 'Little Ice Age' ( LIA) ( 500 - 100 yr BP), and the twentieth century experienced extremes in precipitation possibly associated with changes in ocean - atmosphere teleconnections.

The uppermost cycle probably represents oxygen-isotope glacial Stage 12 (stratigraphic Levels 4 and 3) and interglacial Stage 11 (Levels 3, 2, and 1) as determined by arvicoline biostratigraphic data that place the sequence between 487,000 and 365,000 yr B.P. A no-analog assemblage comprising the bog lemming Mictomys meltoni (of the M. borealis lineage) and the sagebrush vole Lemmiscus curtatus (=Lagurus curtatus) characterizes both the glacial and the interglacial deposits. Climatographs for these two species suggest that, compared to present conditions, the following local climatic limits can be imposed on oxygen-isotope Stages 12 and 11: (1) January effective moisture was greater, resulting from average temperatures of at least 5-degrees-C cooler and/or at least 15 mm more precipitation; (2) January solar radiation was lower by at least 75 Langleys; (3) effective July solar radiation might have been lower by at least 50 Langleys. Seasonal temperature extremes were not necessarily different from those of the present, but seasonal precipitation was more equable. Relative abundance of mammal taxa and sedimentological data indicate that aridity increased at the onset of the interglacial. (C) 1994 University of Washington.

Six centuries of anthropogenic forest change on a Polynesian high island: Archaeological charcoal records from the Marquesas Islands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Anthropogenic processes; Marquesas Islands; Arboriculture; Plant translocations; Wood charcoal; Anthracology	BREADFRUIT ARTOCARPUS-ALTILIS; NUKU HIVA; COLONIZATION; HISTORY; ARBORICULTURE; EXTINCTION; SAPOTACEAE; SEQUENCE; ORIGINS; DECLINE	It is widely recognised that Polynesian settlers developed central Pacific islands into productive economic landscapes, but the character and tempo of these transformations are poorly understood. Archaeological wood charcoal assemblages are uniquely suited to inform on landscape change, especially when the principal food crops were arboreal. We use a large archaeological charcoal collection, drawn from numerous geographically and functionally varied contexts, to develop a multi-scalar vegetation history of Marquesas Islands' lowland forests. Our aims were to: 1) reveal historical patterns of plant biogeography, including introductions by Polynesian settlers; 2) detail the nature and timing of anthropogenic impacts on native Marquesan forests; and 3) track the emergence of economically productive arboreal landscapes. A collection of 6510 fragments identified to 59 taxa inform on a similar to 600-year sequence of human activities. The earliest samples indicate rich forests were encountered by human colonists, comprised of a mix of dicotyledonous hardwood species and woody monocots. These included members of two now-extinct Sapotaceae genera, Planchonella and cf. Sideroxylon, along with Allophylus, a Sapindaceae apparently extirpated from Nuku Hiva. Two important coastal trees, Calophyllum inophyllum and Thespesia populnea, also appear to be indigenous. Polynesian impacts were rapid and widespread, irrevocably altering the indigenous vegetation and disrupting native ecosystems. Samples from later occupations document on-going modifications to lowland vegetation communities. This included inter-valley variability in the timing of transformations and the development of mosaic formations, comprised of native forest interspersed with areas of cultivation and habitation. By 1650 CE, low and mid-elevation vegetation was extensively remodelled, as anthropogenic forests of Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit), Inoccapus fagifer (Tahitian chestnut), and other economic species became widely established and cultivation intensified. Mimicking natural forests, these arboricultural systems helped protect the island's fragile soils and landscapes from recurring climate extremes. Intriguingly, some translocated taxa, including Tahitian chestnut, Casuarina equisetifolia (ironwood), and Morinda citrifolia (Indian mulberry), may have been post-settlement introductions. This analysis demonstrates the potential of archaeological wood charcoal assemblages to inform on Pacific Island vegetation histories, anthropogenic processes, and the evolution of arboricultural economies.

An 11 m drill core was collected between Herbert Sound and Croft Bay as part of the SHALDRIL NBP-0502 initiative and produced the southernmost sediment record from the eastern side of the AP. Thirty-eight radiocarbon ages are used to construct an age model of centennial-scale resolution. Multi-proxy records, including magnetic susceptibility, pebble content, particle size, total organic carbon, and diatom assemblages, were interrogated in the context of nearby Holocene-age ice core, lake, and drift records from James Ross Island. Differences in the timing and expression of Holocene events reflect marine controls on tidewater glaciers, such as water mass configurations and sea ice. Glacial behavior mimics ice core paleotemperatures during the Holocene, with the exception of distinct ocean warming events. Herbert Sound was fully occupied by grounded ice during the Last Glacial Maximum, and experienced rapid lift-off, followed by a floating ice phase. The canopy of floating ice receded by 10 +/- 2.4 cal kyr BP, presumably in response to Early Holocene warming. Herbert Sound and Croft Bay fully deglaciated by 7.2 cal kyr BP, when the Mid Holocene Hypsithermal commenced and the sound became open and productive. An extreme peak in productivity similar to 6.1 cal kyr BP indicates an oceanic warming event that is not reflected in atmospheric temperature or lacustrine sediment records. Increase in sea ice cover and ice rafting mark the onset of the Neoglacial similar to 2.5 cal kyr BP, when pronounced atmospheric cooling is documented in the James Ross Island ice core. Our comparison facilitates more holistic understanding of atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere interactions that may aid predictions of glacial response to future warming and sea-level scenarios.

Parts of the coastline are developing rapidly, especially in Oman. This calls for a proper understanding of the natural processes that act on and affect it. This can be done by investigating the magnitude and impact of past events, in particular on human settlements. By doing this, future risks may not only be scientifically predicted and evaluated, but the damage caused by future events might even be mitigated. Evidence of past extreme wave events is preserved in the onshore stratigraphic record. In addition to this, the coastal zone of Oman is rich in archaeological remains. Presented here are the results of comprehensive mapping and analysis of extreme wave deposits of an archaeological site near Ras al-Hadd, suggesting that the Early Bronze Age site HD-6 was inundated at 4450 cal. BP. An event layer is identified between two settlement phases within the archaeological excavation. A contemporaneous sand bed with a maximum thickness of 0.4 m was mapped in the vicinity of the settlement. Ground penetrating radar surveys allow measurement of the thickness as well as identification of the internal facies architecture of the deposit. A high resolution digital elevation model reveals the coastal geomorphology. It is concluded that the causative event must have been a tsunami that was most likely generated within the Makran Subduction Zone. This interpretation does however, remain tentative at the moment Archaeological evidence indicates that the site was immediately re-occupied after the event, which attests to a certain resiliences of the Early Bronze Age coastal communities in the region.

We report on the archaeological and palaeoecological investigation of a stratified rock shelter (site AGA-3) on Agakauitai Island, revealing a sequence of environmental transformation following Polynesian colonisation of the archipelago. Radiocarbon dates indicate use of the rock shelter from the 13th to the mid-17th centuries, followed by a sterile depositional hiatus, and then final early post-contact use (late 18th to early 19th century). Zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains indicates rapid declines in local populations of seabirds, especially procellariids, as well as later increases in numbers of the introduced, commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans). Macro- and micro-botanical evidence documents transformation of the island's flora from indigenous forest to one dominated by economic plants and fire-resistant taxa. A multi-causal model of dynamic interactions, including nutrient depletion due to seabird loss, most likely accounts for this dramatic ecological transformation. Resume Les iles de l'archipel des Gambier, en Polynesie francaise, sont notamment connues pour leur deforestation extreme et leur faible biodiversite dont temoignaient deja les ecrits des premiers occidentaux. Nous presentons ici les resultats d'un projet de recherche portant sur l'etude archeologique et paleoecologique d'un abri-sous-roche stratifie (site AGA-3) sur l'ile d'Agakauitai. Nos travaux demontrent une sequence de transformations environnementales qui debuterent immediatement apres la colonisation Polynesienne de l'archipel. Les datations radiocarbone indiquent que cet abri fut utilise continuellement entre le 13(eme) et le milieu du 17(eme) siecle AD. Suite a une interruption de l'occupation marquee par un depot sterile, l'abri est finalement reutilise au cours de la periode post-europeenne (fin 18(eme) - debut 19(eme) siecle). L'analyse zooarcheologique des restes fauniques demontre un rapide declin des populations locales d'oiseaux marins, en particulier les procellariides, ainsi qu'une augmentation plus tardive du nombre de restes de rat Pacifique (Rattus exulans), une espece commensale introduite par les Polynesiens. L'etude des restes micro- et macrobotaniques documente egalement la transformation de la flore de l'ile en demontrant une evolution du couvert vegetal passant d'une foret indigene a un environnement domine par les plantes a valeur economique ainsi que des taxons resistants au feu. Le modele d'interactions dynamiques a plusieurs facteurs ici propose, integrant notamment la perte de nutriments consecutive a la disparition des oiseaux marins, constitue a present l'explication la plus plausible a cette dramatique transformation ecologique.

Mapping stone surface temperature fluctuations: Implications for lichen distribution and biomodification on historic stone surfaces	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE			English	Article						Surface temperature fluctuations; Lichen; Limestone; Bioreceptivity; Biomodification; Bioprotection; Biodeterioration; Infrared thermometer	BIODETERIORATION; BIOPROTECTION; COLONIZATION; LIMESTONE; ROCKS; SPAIN	The exposure of historic stone to processes of lichen-induced surface biomodification is determined, first and foremost, by the bioreceptivity of those surfaces to lichen colonization. As an important component of surface bioreceptivity, spatiotemporal variation in stone surface temperature plays a critical role in the spatial distribution of saxicolous lichen on historic stone structures, especially within seasonally hot environments. The ornate limestone and tufa stairwell of the Monastery of Cartuja (1516), Granada, Spain, exhibits significant aspect-related differences in lichen distribution. Lichen coverage and diurnal fluctuations in stone surface temperature on the stairwell were monitored and mapped, under anticyclonic conditions in summer and winter, using an infrared thermometer and Geographical Information Systems approach. This research suggests that it is not extreme high surface temperatures that determine the presence or absence of lichen coverage on stonework. Instead, average stone surface temperatures over the course of the year seem to play a critical role in determining whether or not surfaces are receptive to lichen colonization and subsequent biomodification. It is inferred that lichen, capable of surviving extreme surface temperatures during the Mediterranean summer in an ametabolic state, require a respite period of lower temperatures within which they can metabolize, grow and reproduce. The higher the average annual temperature a surface experiences, the shorter the respite period for any lichen potentially inhabiting that surface. A critical average temperature threshold of approximately 21 degrees C has been identified on the stairwell, with average stone surface temperatures greater than this generally inhibiting lichen colonization. A brief visual condition assessment between lichen-covered and lichen-free surfaces on the limestone sections of the stairwell suggests relative bioprotection induced by lichen coverage, with stonework quality and sharpness remaining more defined beneath lichen-covered surfaces. The methodology employed in this paper may have further applications in the monitoring and mapping of thermal stress fatigue on historic building materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Unravelling the Late Pleistocene habitat of the southernmost woolly mammoths in Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Stable isotopes; Woolly mammoth; Latest Pleistocene; 'El Padul' peat-bog; Granada Basin	CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; STABLE-ISOTOPE; BONE-COLLAGEN; MIGRATION PATTERNS; MAMMALIAN BONE; CLIMATE; PHOSPHATE; NITROGEN; DIET	The southernmost record of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) in Europe has been found in Late Pleistocene sediments from 'El Padul' peat-bog, in the Granada Basin (southern Spain). In this paper we discuss a plausible habitat based on stable isotopic analyses of these specimens, dated similar to 40-30 cal ky BP, probably corresponding with the beginning of Heinrich Stadial 4 (HS4) and the end of Heinrich Stadial 3 (HS3). Woolly mammoth remains preserve an accurate isotopic register of past climatic conditions because they needed to ingest large amount of resources daily (water and fresh food), whose isotopic signature, influenced by the environmental conditions, was recorded in their tissues. The delta O-18(w), values of the past meteoric waters (-5.47 parts per thousand to -6.7 parts per thousand vs V-SMOW), calculated from the isotopic composition of teeth enamel, suggest moderate temperatures in comparison with those of similar age recovered in central and northern Europe. Due to its geographic position in southern Europe, our samples recorded the highest delta O-18 of past meteoric waters deduced from mammoth remains in Europe. The difference between these values and those of delta O-18(w) current mean annual precipitation are minimal, contrasting with those of higher latitudes during the end of the last glaciation (similar to 50 to similar to 20 cal ky BP). The isotopic values of nitrogen (10.1 parts per thousand, to 13.2 parts per thousand vs AIR) and carbon (-20.7 to -21.8 parts per thousand vs V-PDB) of collagen show a dry habitat, which occasionally could have been extreme. Taken as a whole, the isotopic results suggest that the studied specimens lived in a very dry steppic area, with moderately cold conditions, contrasting with the wet environment of 'El Padul' peat-bog, and its colder temperatures, due to the influence of glacial conditions of the Sierra Nevada, the highest peninsular mountain range. The described habitat may be sited in a more westerly position than the 'El Padul' peat-bog, and it was warmer and drier than those of contemporaneous European woolly mammoths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The conclusion can be drawn as follows: In general, the UHI intensity of Nanjing is about 0.5 degrees C, with a high-value intensity found when the lowest temperature appears during the night, reaching approximately 6 degrees C in extreme cases. The UHI effect in Nanjing has obvious seasonal and daily change characteristics. The UHI intensity of summer is higher than that of winter and that in nighttime is higher than that in daytime. Along with urban scale development, the UHI intensity of Nanjing is increasing. Its increase rate is 0.109 degrees C/10 a, calculated by annual mean air temperatures. The UHI phenomena mainly occurred from the 1980s to the 1990s, especially in the 1990s, which was related to the rapid urbanization period in China. The UHI intensity slightly declined after 2000, which was in correlation with the green land increase in Nanjing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Human socio-economic adaptation to environment in Late Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic Eastern Europe	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CHRONOLOGY	The choice of adaptation ways depended considerably on social capabilities of prehistoric societies at different stage of anthropogenesis and material culture development. Studies performed on the East European Plain revealed essential features of systems of human adaptations at the Middle Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic and later stages. The migratory type of adaptation was dominant at the Middle Paleolithic and at the beginning of Upper Paleolithic time when early humans were completely dependent on fluctuations of climate and environments. Since the second half of Upper Paleolithic the adaptability of humans increased with development and active use of a number of protective measures; under those conditions, the autochthonous type of adaptation became prevalent that ensured human survival even in extreme conditions. In later epochs a diffusion type made itself felt, which contributed to a relatively fast penetration of productive economy into various landscape systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Ages and 1 sigma external uncertainties for Austanbotnbreen moraines range from 7.4 +/- 0.75 ka to 8.7 +/- 0.9 ka when no adjustment for snow shielding is made. With the maximum conceivable snow cover effect (2 m thick, a density of 0.2 g/cm(3), 6 months duration) at the exposed site, the resulting adjusted (7.7 +/- 0.8 to 10.9 +/- 1.3 ka) as well as unadjusted ages suggest moraine formation possibly during both the 8.2 ka event (Finse Event in southern Norway) and the Erdalen Event (c. 10.0 ka). In contrast, ages obtained for the outer ridges of the large moraine complex in front of Ostre Tundradalskyrkjabre range from 1.1 +/- 0.3 ka to 1.9 +/- 0.4 ka assuming no snow shielding. Assuming extreme snow-lie conditions (4 m thick, 0.2 g/cm(3) density, 6 months duration) at this more sheltered site, the adjusted ages (1.4 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 ka) still indicate late-Holocene, pre-'Little Ice Age' ridge formation. Less likely alternative explanations of the late-Holocene ages, including avalanching of debris onto the moraine, inventories of inherited nuclides in the samples and possible episodic 'push-deformation' disturbance of the ice-cored moraine complex, are discussed. The results point to the potential of surface exposure dating in reconstructing Holocene glacier variation chronologies, particularly with respect to high-altitude glaciers and to individualistic responses of these glaciers to Holocene millennial-scale climatic fluctuations. Difficulties with dating moraines in front of small high-altitude glaciers using cosmogenic nuclides, including uncertain snow shielding effect, short glacial transport distance, possibly not 'zeroing' an inherited cosmogenic signal and repeated disturbance of a moraine complex, are discussed.

Radiocarbon dating of the palaeosols suggests that drift reworking at this site involved brief, intermittent episodes of debrisflow and slopewash activity since c. 6.5 cal. ka BP. At least four such phases can be recognized: c. 6.5-6.2, 5.6-5.3, 4.9-4.6 cal. ka BP and after c. 450 cal. BP. The palaeosols examined show no evidence of local burning of vegetation. A calibrated radiocarbon age for the onset of the most recent phase of reworking may be interpreted as reflecting woodland clearance and/or the influence of extreme rainfall events during the 'Little Ice Age' period of regional climatic deterioration. The combined chronostratigraphic and palaeoecological evidence points to discrete, local rainstorms that are seemingly unrelated to long-term climatic change as the most likely cause of enhanced slope reworking, at least prior to c. 450 cal. BP. If this interpretation is valid, it implies that the formation of Holocene debris cones elsewhere in upland Britain may have been due primarily to a small number of localized, extreme rainstorm events. Consequently, caution is necessary in using debrisflow chronostratigraphy alone as a means of reconstructing long-term climate patterns.

A 1-Ma record of sea surface temperature and extreme cooling events in the North Atlantic: A perspective from the Iberian Margin	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Sea Surface Temperature; Iberian Margin; Mid-latitudes; Mid-Pleistocene transition; Lipid biomarkers	MIDPLEISTOCENE CLIMATE TRANSITION; MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE TRANSITION; OCEAN CIRCULATION; ICE-VOLUME; INDEX U-37(K'); BRUNHES EVENT; SITE U1385; TIME-SCALE; 800-400 KA; VARIABILITY	The Iberian Margin is a sensitive area to track high and low latitude processes, and is a key location to understand major past climatic and oceanographic changes. Here we present new biomarker data from IODP Site U1385 ("Shackleton site") (1017-336 ka) that, when combined with existing data from Cores MD01-2443/4 (last 335 ka), allows us to assess the evolution of sea surface temperature (SST) and meltwater influx over the last 1 Ma at the Iberian Margin. Interglacial periods throughout the last 1 Ma show SST close to 20 degrees C, even during the so-called "luke-warm" interglacials that are marked by relatively low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During glacial periods, extremely cold stadial events are recognized at the Iberian Margin, and are very likely related to meltwater discharges from the European and British-Irish ice sheets into the NE Atlantic, which were transported southwards by the Portugal Current. We subdivided the record into four intervals on the basis of the timing and the magnitude of these extremely cold stadials: 1) from 1017 to similar to 900 ka, only minor sporadic freshwater input occurred during deglaciations; 2) from 900 to 675 ka extreme cold events occur as terminal stadial events at the beginning of the deglaciations, which results in abrupt deglacial SST shifts; 3) from 675 to 450 ka only a few, very short-lived events are recorded and seldom is there freshwater input at the Iberian Margin; 4) during the last 450 ka the extreme cold events occurred under full glacial conditions, with particularly severe events during MIS 6 and 8. We propose these mid -glacial events are associated with a strong discharges of European ice sheet (EIS). The fact that these extreme cold events do not coincide with deglaciations questions the role of European ice sheet discharges in triggering deglaciations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pollen-based evidence of extreme drought during the last Glacial (32.6-9.0 ka) in coastal southern California	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Drought; California; Pollen; Lake Elsinore; Wisconsinan; Climate; Ecosystems	SANTA-ROSA-ISLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGIC VARIABILITY; LATE PLEISTOCENE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CHANNEL-ISLANDS; NORTH-AMERICA; LAKE ELSINORE; GREAT-BASIN; PACIFIC	High resolution pollen analyses of sediment core LEDC10-1 from Lake Elsinore yield the first well-dated, terrestrial record of sub-centennial-scale ecologic change in coastal southern California between similar to 32 and 9 ka. In the Lake Elsinore watershed, the initial, mesic montane conifer forests dominated by Pinus, and Cupressaceae with trace amounts of Abies and Picea were replaced by a sequence of multiple, extended severe mega-droughts between similar to 27.5 and similar to 25.5 ka, in which halophytic and xerophytic herbs and shrubs occupied an ephemeral lake. This prolonged and extended dry interval, which corresponds with warm waters offshore, imply strengthening of the North Pacific High and persistent below-average winter precipitation. The subsequent, contrasting monotonic occurrence of montane conifers reflects little variation in cold, mesic climate until similar to 15 ka. Postglacial development of Quercus woodland and chaparral mark the return to more xeric, warmer conditions at this time. A brief reversal at similar to 13.1-similar to 12.1 ka, as reflected by an expansion of Pinus, is correlative with the Younger Dryas and interrupts development of warm, postglacial climate. Subsequent gradual expansion of xeric vegetation post Younger Dryas denotes the establishment of a winter hydroclimate regime in coastal southern California that is more similar to modern conditions. Pollen-based reconstructions of temperature and precipitation at Lake Elsinore are generally correlative with pollen-based paleoclimatic reconstructions and foraminiferabased sea surface temperatures from Santa Barbara Basin in marine core ODP 893. The conspicuous absence of the similar to 27.5-similar to 25.5 ka glacial "mega-drought" in the Santa Barbara Basin pollen record highlights the sensitivity of Lake Elsinore to hydroclimate change, and thus, the importance of this new record that indicates that mega-drought can occur during the full glacial when climatic boundary conditions and forcings differed substantially from the present.

Changes of the 7-day low flow (LF7) are analyzed based on long streamflow series at 5 hydrological using Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope analysis. The results indicate that: (1) at the monthly scale, the LF7 peaks during June-August at the riverhead of the Tarim basin; at the annual scale, however, the LF7 peaked during 1962-2008. In the mainstream of the Tarim River, the LF7 peaks during July September and peaked during 1962-2008; (2) the LF7 was increasing before 1999 at the Kaqun station and this trend is significant statistically during 1991-1999. The LF7 at other hydrological stations showed decreasing trends from 1962 to the mid-1970s or early-1980s. Increased LF7 can be detected after change points, which should be attributed to increased temperature since the increased temperature can enhance melting processes; (3) the LF7 occurs during May June, which should be the result of increased irrigation demand and trapping effects of water reservoirs. The results of this study should be significant for regional water resource management under the influences of intensifying human activities and changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Cyanobacteria as potential biomarkers of hydrological changes in the Late Quaternary sediments of South Kerala Sedimentary Basin, India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATORS; BLOOMS	Cyanobacteria tolerate extreme hydrological regimes, and their mucilaginous filaments account for binding and preservation of delicate structures. As the hydrological set-up is controlled by rainfall, they serve as biomarkers to distinguish palaeoenvironmental scenario and ecological shifts ranging from Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene (40 ka-2.5 ka) in the studied boreholes of the South Kerala Basin (Ayiramthengu, Panavally and West Kallada). The accrued cyanobacteria microflora. is unique, as it has different morphotypes of Rivularia sp. and Gloeotrichia sp. at varying levels in the sediment profiles, probably reflecting the signatures of hydrological modifications associated with the development of wetland system. The response of cyanobacteria is similar in Panavally and Ayiramthengu from Early to Late Holocene with short signals of pauses probably relating to aberrations in precipitation. However, the Late Pleistocene and Late Holocene periods show a poor record of cyanobacteria reflecting decline in rainfall and prevalence of long spell of dry phase. From Early Holocene to Middle Holocene, the turnover of cyanobacteria has been prolific, which may be due to the Holocene Optimum rainfall. Relatively larger size and better carbonised and smaller size and lighter coloured morphotypes are correlated with such hydrological modifications as a result of high and low rainfall respectively during the Early Holocene and Late Holocene. As the cyanobacteria have the potential for adaptation and stabilization of numerous specialized eco- and morphotypes in time and space, they provided additional palaeodata as good biomarkers of climatic change.

Delicious guinea pigs: Seasonality studies and the use of fat in the pre-Columbian Andean diet	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							PROTEIN; SUBSISTENCE; STRATEGIES; MAIZE; LLAMA	In the Nearctic ecozone (temperate, subarctic, and arctic environments) hunter gatherers often have to rely on diets with inadequate caloric intakes during certain times of the year. Although the Neotropic ecozone has different and less extreme conditions, it can also be nutritionally challenging. While the tropical forests offer a more stable diet (in terms of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat availability), high altitude biomes, such as the central Andes, can challenge human populations to metabolize proteins properly in certain times of the year.

Examination of diatom-based changes from a climatically sensitive prairie lake (Saskatchewan, Canada) at different temporal perspectives	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; SOUTHWESTERN SASKATCHEWAN; HOLOCENE HISTORY; CENTRAL ALBERTA; SCALE SHIFTS; HARRIS LAKE; CLIMATE; RECORD; SALINITY; AMERICA	Paleoclimatic records from the climatically sensitive Canadian prairies are relatively rare due to the scarcity of study sites with continuous Holocene stratigraphic sequences. Oro Lake, a meromictic lake in the dry grasslands of Saskatchewan (Canada), contains a continuous Holocene diatom record spanning the last similar to 10,000 years. Here we present analyses at three different time scales and resolution: (1) 1-3 yr resolution of the past similar to 80 years, (2) century-scale analysis of the Holocene, and (3) decadal-scale analysis of the past similar to 7000 years. Recent changes in the diatom assemblages and their respective salinity inferences were significantly related to measured effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation, P-ET). The droughts of the 1930s, and a wet period during the 1950s are clearly evident in the diatom record, suggesting the Oro Lake record contains a sensitive archive of past climatic conditions. Century-scale analysis of the diatom record during the Holocene is consistent with a cool and moist climate in the early Holocene (prior to ca 9700cal yr BP, 8600 C-14 yr BP). An abrupt increase in diatom-inferred salinity at 9600 cal yr BP (8500 C-14 yr BP) indicates the onset of an and climate, with continuing and conditions throughout the mid-Holocene. Decadal-scale analysis of the past similar to 7000 years suggests that the mid-Holocene was more complex, with extended periods of increased variability in precipitation, particularly between ca 5800-3600 cal yr BP (5000-3200 C-14 yr BP) which is characterized by intervals of increased effective moisture. The past similar to 2000 years is characterized by reduced salinities and generally wetter conditions in comparison to the mid-Holocene. The combination of the different scales of analyses in this study provides a detailed account of the dynamic nature of climate from sub-decadal to millennial scale in the Oro Lake region within the Palliser Triangle. Climate model predictions suggest that the Canadian prairie region may see a higher frequency of extreme droughts under projected global warming, potentially similar to the most and periods seen during the mid-Holocene when many lake basins completely dried out.

Paleo-reconstructions can provide concrete evidence of how these major features of the atmospheric circulation can change in response to climate perturbations. While most such reconstructions have focused on ITCZ-related rainfall, here we show that trade wind proxies can document dynamical aspects of meridional ITCZ shifts. Theoretical expectations based on angular momentum constraints and results from freshwater hosing simulations with two different climate models predict that ITCZ shifts due to anomalous cooling of one hemisphere would be accompanied by a strengthening of the Hadley cell and trade winds in the colder hemisphere, with an opposite response in the warmer hemisphere. This expectation of hemispherically asymmetric trade wind changes is confirmed by proxy data of coastal upwelling and windblown dust from the Atlantic basin during Heinrich stadials, showing trade wind strengthening in the Northern Hemisphere and weakening in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics in concert with southward ITCZ shifts. Data from other basins show broadly similar patterns, though improved constraints on past trade wind changes are needed outside the Atlantic Basin. The asymmetric trade wind changes identified here suggest that ITCZ shifts are also marked by intensification of the ocean's wind-driven subtropical cells in the cooler hemisphere and a weakening in the warmer hemisphere, which induces cross-equatorial oceanic heat transport into the colder hemisphere. This response would be expected to prevent extreme meridional ITCZ shifts in response to asymmetric heating or cooling. Understanding trade wind changes and their coupling to cross-equatorial ocean cells is key to better constraining ITCZ shifts and ocean and atmosphere dynamical changes in the past, especially for regions and time periods for which few paleodata exist, and also improves our understanding of what changes may occur in the future.

Despite its importance for understanding past human impact and climate change, high-resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Holocene hydroclimate variability, and in particular records of extreme precipitation events in the area, are rare. Here we present a 7500-year-long high-resolution record of past climatic change and human impact recorded in a peatbog from the Southern Carpathians, integrating palynological, geochemical and sedimentological proxies. Natural climate fluctuations appear to be dominant until 4500 years before present (yr BP), followed by increasing importance of human impact. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses document regular minerogenic deposition within the bog, linked to periods of high precipitation. Such minerogenic depositional events began 4000 yr BP, with increased depositional rates during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and during periods of societal upheaval (e.g. the Roman conquest of Dacia). The timing of minerogenic events appears to indicate a teleconnection between major shifts in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and hydroclimate variability in southeastern Europe, with increased minerogenic deposition correlating to low NAO index values. By linking the minerogenic deposition to precipitation variability, we state that this link persists throughout the mid-to -late Holocene. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The site is one of a handful in southern Africa that preserves human occupations before, during, and after the Last GlacialMaximum (LGM). The site's long and well-preserved sequence makes it relevant to addressing questions of humanmobility, subsistence, and technology in relation to broader environmental change. Here we present a Bayesian-modelled radiocarbon chronology for the LGM and terminal Pleistocene occupations at Sehonghong. Our model incorporates previously published radiocarbon dates and new accelerator mass spectrometry ages. We also present archaeological evidence to test the hypothesis that Sehonghong was occupied in a series of punctuated events, and that some of these occupations were more intensive than others. Previous chronological and archaeological data were insufficient for testing these hypotheses. The new dates and archaeological data confirm that the site was occupied intensively in the early LGM and immediately thereafter. The site was otherwise occupied sporadically. We find that greater site occupation density is not always correlated with intensified use of local resources as measured by increased bipolar reduction and fish consumption. The new dates further confirm that Sehonghong contains some of the oldest evidence for systematic freshwater fishing in southern Africa. The availability of fish, a high fat protein source, probably stimulated human occupation, however sporadic, of such montane environments during cooler and drier periods. These findings suggest behavioural variability in response to shifting mobility and subsistence strategies. Our brief discussion informs upon hunter-gatherer occupation of southern African montane environments more broadly and human behavioural variability during the LGM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence for extreme floods in arid subtropical northwest Australia during the Little Ice Age chronozone (CE 1400-1850)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Hydroclimate; Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ); Late Holocene; Little Ice Age (LIA); Sediment; Paleolimnology; Pilbara	TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDIAN-OCEAN; PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SUMMER MONSOON; POLLEN RECORD	Here we report a similar to 2000-year sediment sequence from the Fortescue Marsh (Martuyitha) in the eastern Pilbara region, which we have used to investigate changing hydroclimatic conditions in the arid subtropics of northwest Australia. The Pilbara is located at the intersection of the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans and its modern rainfall regime is strongly influenced by tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. We identified four distinct periods within the record. The most recent period (P1: CE similar to 1990-present) reveals hydroclimatic conditions over recent decades that are the most persistently wet of potentially the last similar to 2000 years. During the previous centuries (P2: similar to CE 1600-1990), the Fortescue Marsh was overall drier but likely punctuated by a number of extreme floods, which are defined here as extraordinary, strongly episodic floods in drylands generated by rainfall events of high volume and intensity. The occurrence of extreme floods during this period, which encompasses the Little Ice Age (LIA; CE 1400-1850), is coherent with other southern tropical datasets along the ITCZ over the last 2000 years, suggesting synchronous hydroclimatic changes across the region. This extreme flood period was preceded by several hundred years (P3: similar to CE 700-1600) of less vigorous but more regular flows. The earliest period of the sediment record (P4: similar to CE 100-700) was the most arid, with sedimentary and preservation processes driven by prolonged drought. Our results highlight the importance of developing paleoclimate records from the tropical and sub-tropical arid zone, providing a long-term baseline of hydrological conditions in areas with limited historical observations.

Despite this wealth of information, very little is known about population dynamics during this period. For that reason, the main concern of this paper is to provide socio-environmental models that may help explain Early Middle Paleolithic (EMP) population dynamics in NW Iberia, assessing to what extent they were shaped by climate forces. The archaeological record is analyzed on the basis of the heuristics of ecological models, already employed in the European Pleistocene record but never at a regional scale, in order to detect long-term changes in the composition of EMP populations, and the environmental, biological and sociocultural process influencing those changes. According to the models proposed, we have detected a long-term population dynamic between MIS 11 and MIS 6, characterized by low environmental stress, high biological productivity, interaction among populations and sociocultural complexity. Eventually, this population dynamic was broken due to an extreme climate phase in late MIS 6 that had a profound impact on populations and sociocultural structures. As a result, the Upper Pleistocene population of NW Iberia was concentrated in the Cantabrian region. This area became an isolated Neanderthal glacial refugium that hosted a population with different origins and fragile long-term demographic stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The abnormality index K was adopted for assessing the changing trends of the climate extremes. Our results sufficiently demonstrated increasing trends of the air temperature during the studied period (1941-2011) in Kazakhstan for all seasons. A weak decreasing trend of the annual precipitation was also detected.

The changing architecture of sea-level lowstand deposits across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition: South Evoikos Gulf, Greece	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Sea level; Pleistocene; Seismic stratigraphy; Sedimentation; Continental shelf; Coastal progradation; Aegean Sea	NEOGENE EVOLUTION; GROWTH-PATTERNS; GLACIO-EUSTASY; ICE VOLUME; QUATERNARY; PLEISTOCENE; BASIN; CLIMATE; STRATIGRAPHY; TEMPERATURE	On subsiding continental shelves, the style of stacked coastal and deltaic progradational packages is directly dependent on relative sea-level changes. In the past similar to 0.6 Ma, sea-level change has been dominated by asymmetric 100 ka eustatic sea-level cycles, whereas the record of sea-level changes in earlier Pleistocene progradational sequences is less clear. In a steadily subsiding basin in which accommodation balances sediment flux, the depth of a eustatic lowstand determines the paleo-depth of the deepest clinoform inflection point and the seaward limit of the erosional transgressive surface, whereas the duration of a lowstand controls the amount of progradation that takes place. We report high-resolution seismic profiles of an exceptionally preserved coastal progradational sequence from a coastal embayment in the Aegean Sea that is subsiding at similar to 100 m/Ma. The seismic profiles show clinoforms of smaller amplitude and volume that were deposited before the 100 ka cyclic progradational units. This contrasts with literature reports of complexity in progradational sequences at that time. We assume that published stacked benthic foram O-isotope records are a good proxy for the duration and a reasonable proxy for the amplitude of Pleistocene eustatic sea-level cycles. The MIS 6-5 eustatic sea-level rise is recognised based on sedimentation rates from cores. The underlying major progradational units are correlated with the long-duration, extreme lowstand 100 ka cycles of MIS 6,12 and 16. Changes in the elevation of lowstand inflection points in clinoforms are used to tentatively extend the record back to MIS 38, by comparison with the benthic foram proxy. The deposits of the higher and longer highstands of MIS 25, 31 and 37 are also recognised. This record provides a testable template for future studies of short early Pleistocene sections on land and raises questions of detail about parts of the published delta O-18 records. It independently supports the recent evidence that the Mid-Pleistocene transition was an abrupt event, with an extreme lowstand in MIS 22. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Holocene centennial- and millennial-scale climate fluctuations are relatively subtle and more frequent than those of glacial/interglacial transitions, therefore intrinsic factors such as rock type or basin size are hypothesized to moderate significantly the influence of Holocene climate and climate change on alluvial fan processes. Here, we examine variability in styles and rates of alluvial fan aggradation along a single mountain front that is characterized by basins of varying size and rock type (carbonate versus granite). Basin rock type is more closely correlated to variability in the episodic nature and magnitude of alluvial fan aggradation than is basin area. Bedrock physical and chemical weathering properties control sediment delivery to the piedmont and thus influence alluvial fan aggradation. We suggest that the particle size of grus produced by weathering of granitic rocks fosters sediment mobilization and alluvial fan aggradation during episodes of increased precipitation in the Holocene. Sediment mobilization during wetter climates is also possibly enhanced by drought-related fires and vegetation loss that occurred during preceding drier periods. In contrast, carbonate outcrops weather to both dissolved materials and clastic sediment and relatively rapid cementation of talus precludes its transportation out onto the piedmont under almost all Holocene climatic conditions. If the scale of past Holocene climate change is the closest analogy to current global change, this study documents some mechanisms by which different rock types can exert dramatically different effects on landscape response to those changes.

Evidence from soil development and distribution	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; WESTERN JORDAN; QUATERNARY; EROSION; MOROCCO	Historic land use was found to impact soil development directly in the Decapolis region in Northern Jordan, leading to re-distribution, not simply erosion and degradation of soils. Several authors proposed that land use had a strongly negative impact on soil development in semi-arid areas, leading to desertification. The term desertification was used to describe erosion, caused by land use, as the reason for an advance of deserts and the abandonment of ancient sites. However, evidence from Jordan shows that erosion is a most unlikely cause for the abandonment of historic sites. Land use lasting over centuries seemingly changed the character of the landscape and can be traced through distinct soil development. Soils may have been degraded since prehistoric times and it seems possible that major erosion in the Decapolis region was not primarily related to land use or increased rainfall, but to more frequent extreme events interrupting prolonged droughts. As global warming seems likely, it is important to consider the impact of climate on landscape development in future management plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

In Sudan, the July rainfall was unusually early and heavy, and persistent rains throughout August and early September caused severe floods in much of central Sudan, including Khartoum. The synoptic conditions historically associated with extreme rainfall events in central Sudan include a warm equatorial Indian Ocean, a strong summer monsoon over both Africa and India, a northward shift of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone earlier and further north than usual, and the presence of deep, well-developed westerly air masses accompanied by a strong Tropical Easterly Jet that allowed more moisture transport into Africa from the South Atlantic via the Congo basin, leading to very heavy precipitation in the Ethiopian uplands and the central Sudan. The intense late wet season rains in 1999 caused a major canal in the Gezira Irrigation Area to break its banks and filled normally dry depressions between dunes with water, providing a partial analogue of early Holocene environments in this region when small groups of Later Stone Age peoples occupied the sandy ridges seasonally. Global Circulation Models cannot provide such detailed local information. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

In this study, based on daily precipitation records from 22 meteorological stations, several methods were used to detect the spatial-temporal distribution, abrupt change and return periods for six extreme precipitation indices as well as the total annual precipitation during 1938-2005 in CA. The results show that all precipitation indices experienced increasing trend except for annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD), which had a significant decreasing trend. Abrupt changes for most of precipitation indices mainly occurred around 1957 during 1938-2005. Return periods for all seven precipitation indices concentrated in 10-year period. Meanwhile, all precipitation indices showed spatial diversity and heterogeneity, and the entire area tended to be wetter and experienced fewer dry conditions. Understanding these changes of precipitation extremes in CA will definitely benefit to water resource management, natural hazard prevention and mitigation, and reliable future projections in this region.

Several forestless episodes, dated to 5245-5155 cal BP, 4525-4395 cal BP and 3940-3050 cal BP, were preceded by tree dying-off phases caused by an extreme periodical increase in humidity and general climate cooling trends. These events are documented based on analyses of pollen and non-pollen palynomorph assemblages, dendrochronological analyses of the trees, as well as numerous radiocarbon datings of the sediment horizons occurring within the peat bog profile. The phases of germinations, and, in turn, of tree and shrub invasions of the peat bog areas have been closely connected to drying and occasional warming of the regional climate. The last of the forestless periods began about 2600 years ago and continued up to the very recent times. Currently, as a result of desiccation of the peat bog and the lowering of the groundwater level (due to improved water drainage system), pine trees have returned the peat bog again. These results demonstrate that studies of subfossil bog-pine trees are quite effective in documenting and reconstructing periods of humidity fluctuation that occurred within the Carpathian region over the last several millennia.

The island of Corfu is located in an area of exceptional tectonic stress: towards the south, the African oceanic plate is being subducted underneath the Aegean plate, whereas towards the north, the Adriatic and European plates form a continental collision zone. Recent publications provide evidence of earthquake related co-seismic movements that potentially trigger extreme wave events as well as relative sea level fluctuations. In this context, we investigated two selected near-coast geological archives-the Chalikiopoulou Lagoon in the east and the Korission Lagoon in the southwest of Corfu Island. Our results clearly document that the eastern as well as the southwestern coasts of Corfu were repeatedly affected by palaeotsunami impact during the Holocene. With regard to the local topographical constellation and the recent geomorphodynamic potential of each study area, evidence of high-energy wave impact is based on the stratigraphical and microfaunal record of selected vibracoring sites as well as on numerical modelling results. It is concluded that the eastern coast of Corfu is preferably affected by high-energy wave impacts from a southern direction. Such impacts are most likely related to teletsunamis from the major seismical zone of the Hellenic Trench. In contrast, the southwestern coast of Corfu is endangered by impacts from both western and southern directions. Such impacts may comprise teletsunamis triggered in the Hellenic Trench or the Etna regions but may also be caused by local submarine landslides at the steeply sloping continental shelf directly west of Corfu. Our study builds a bridge between palaeotsunami-research conducted in the southern Ionian Sea and the Adriatic Sea and allows to better discriminate between the effects of teletsunamis and locally triggered events within one of the seismically most active regions in the eastern Mediterranean.

We provide a reconstruction of regional vegetation change and local wetland development under influence of sea level rise and inferred climate change between 4400 and 4100 cal. yr BP. Our multi-proxy data evidence a severe drought between 4190 and 4130 cal. yr BP, which ultimately led to mass mortality of larger vertebrates, including two species of giant tortoises and dodos in a <2-ha region. This prolonged drought around the Indian Ocean is recorded in many regions dependent on monsoon precipitation and is suggested to cause the collapse of human societies in East Africa and India. We demonstrate a direct relation between the mass mortality events in the Mare aux Songes (MAS) rock valley and the 4200 cal. yr BP drought. MAS represents a fresh water source that attracted and concentrated vertebrates. Abrupt increased aridity induced regional fires on Mauritius and caused decreased water levels, and a shrinking water surface resulting in further concentration of the animals in this coastal site. Upconing of the saline wedge underlying the fresh water source induced progressive salinization. The excrements of the animals produced hypertrophic conditions that, combined with salinization and high temperatures, created a suitable environment for potentially toxic cyanobacteria. These factors led to a deadly cocktail, resulting in the death of 100,000s of vertebrates by intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring, and promoted a unique conservation of fossils. The 4.2ka megadrought' likely induced similar bottlenecks elsewhere in the SW Indian Ocean region.

However, the process and mechanism of paleofloods in the basin remain unsolved. This paper describes studies of the periodicity and process of paleofloods in Guanting basin during the mid-Holocene and their relations to monsoon strength, based on geological and archaeological investigations, including analysis of magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance, application of radiocarbon dating and comparison with the stalagmite oxygen isotope record in Dongge Cave. During the mid-Holocene, paleofloods in Guanting basin began between 7550 cal a BP and 6510 cal a BP, and lasted to 2220 cal a BP at least. Four cycles of frequent followed by infrequent paleofloods have been detected. Three periods of infrequent paleofloods occurred during 4380-3970 cal a BP, 2850-2720 cal a BP and 2310-2140 cal a BP respectively. The other one took place around 5000 cal a BP, coinciding well with periods of weak Asian monsoon events. The process of paleofloods in Guanting basin during the mid-Holocene was possibly dominated by the precipitation changes responding to Asian monsoon strength. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Human landscapes of the Late Glacial Period in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula: La Pena de Estebanvela (Segovia, Spain)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							RECORD	The chronostratigraphic framework of the Magdalenian in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula currently covers the period 21,440-21,040 cal BP (level 2 of the Cueva del Gato site at Epila, Province of Zaragoza) to 12,770-12,570 cal BP (level I of the La Pena de Estebanvela site, Ayllon, Province of Segovia). These dates embrace times of strong climatic oscillation, beginning with very rigorous environmental conditions (stage GS2) and ending with a temperate climate (Allerod); over this period, extreme events such as Heinrich event 1 occurred. However, little information is available that would allow the environments through which human groups moved during the Late last Glacial of the Iberian interior to be characterised. The La Pena de Estebanvela site is something of an exception in that its archaeological features allow the reconstruction of the surrounding environment, and provide information on how natural resources may have been used. The faunal remains represented at this site reflect changes in palaeoecology over time. Taphonomic analysis of recovered macromammals and lagomorphs shows that these animals were brought to the site, butchered and consumed. The available data on seasonality fix the occupation of levels I-III from the spring to the autumn. Certain types of wood were collected for use as firewood. Other elements found in the record (personal ornaments, mobiliary art and raw materials) provide evidence that the people that occupied the site moved over a more extensive territory.

The LGM is largely characterized by grasslands and xerophytic herbs dominated open habitats. Arid-LGM punctuated climatic ameliorations, which took place in short episodes. Humans appear to have reached the HP ecosystem after 18,000 cal yrs BP occasionally. The first Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) induced changes in South West Monsoon (SWM) rains occurred at low latitudes between 16,200 and 15,900 cal yrs BP suggesting an onset of monsoon rains. After this event, monsoon rains weakened for several millennia except the period 13,700-13,000 cal yrs BP, but human activity seems to have continued with biomass burning and clearances by slash and burn. Very large size grass pollen grains, which are morphologically similar to pollen from closer forms of Oryza nivara, were found after 13,800 cal yrs BP. Early Holocene extreme and abrupt climate changes seem to have promoted the forms of O. nivara populations in association with humans. New data from the HP would therefore be most interesting to investigate the dispersal and use of domesticated rice in South Asia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, spatial and temporal changes in extreme temperature and extreme precipitation were reconstructed for the period 1960-2009. The method of FFT filtering was used to smooth time series of extreme temperature and extreme precipitation, linear regression to calculate linear fits, and spline interpolation to interpolate station data and estimate linear changes. The results show that the annual extreme temperature increased in most of the area during 1960-2009, especially in the northeast. The greatest increase was the extreme temperature in winter, compared to that in autumn, summer and spring in order from high to low across most of the study area. The annual extreme precipitation changed little in the first three decades and increased significantly in the last two decades, and varied with region and season. Spatially, the annual trend of extreme precipitation increased across most of the province, except in some areas of the southeast. The seasonal change trend of extreme precipitation varied greatly across different areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

An exceptional concentration of catastrophic floods has been reported from the Cordillera Blanca in the first half of 20th Century (1930s-1950s), leading to thousands of fatalities. The main objective of this paper is to provide a revised and comprehensive overview of geomorphologically effective floods in the area of interest, using various documentary data sources, verified by analysis of remotely sensed images (1948-2013) and enhanced by original field data. Verified events (n = 28; 4 not mentioned before) are analysed from the perspective of spatiotemporal distribution, pre-flood conditions, causes, mechanisms and geomorphological impacts as well as socioeconomical consequences, revealing certain patterns and similar features. GLOFs are further classified according to their magnitude: 5 extreme events, 8 major events and 15 minor events are distinguished, referring to the quantified geomorphological and socioeconomical impacts. Selected moraine dams and flood deposits are dated using lichenometric dating. Special attention is given to moraine dam breaches - the most frequent type of water release with the most significant consequences. Selected major events and their consequences are studied in detail in a separate section. Finally, a general schematic model of lake formation, growth and post-flood evolution reflecting initial topographical setting and glacier retreat is introduced and the utilization of the obtained results is outlined.

Drought characteristics were analyzed by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and population exposure to regional droughts in the warming world were then assessed by a combination of the population in 2010. It was revealed that both annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will increase in the 1.5 degrees C warming level relative to the reference period of 1986-2005 in the HRB. But annual precipitation was projected to decrease in the 2.0 degrees C warming level, although potential evapotranspiration was projected to increase. The temperature in the HRB was projected to rise faster than the global mean, and the timing of the regional 2.0 degrees C warming level will come earlier. Under the global warming of 1.5 degrees C, intensity and coverage of droughts in the HRB exhibit no significant trends relative to 1986-2005, while the drought frequency might decrease to a certain degree. Under the global warming of 2.0 degrees C, intensity and coverage of droughts will increase notably. In particular, drought coverage in the 2.0 degrees C level will be 1.9 times larger than that of the 1.5 degrees C scenario. Drought frequency under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario will increase relative to the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario but still be less than that of the reference period. As a result, population exposure to droughts in the 1.5 degrees C warming level could be reduced by 30.4% relative to the 1986e2005 period, but increase by 74.8% in the 2.0 degrees C warming level. Seasonally, an increasing trend of exposure to severe droughts in summer, autumn and winter was projected in the 1.5 degrees C global warming level, while that to extreme droughts in summer and winter will decrease. Under 2.0 degrees C global warming scenario, increasing trend of severe and extreme droughts was projected in spring, autumn and winter. And the exposure to extreme droughts in autumn and winter might be doubled relative to the reference period. Similar spatial distribution patterns were found for population exposure in 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels with high values projected in south and central basin but low in north and west. But the difference is, less population will be exposed to droughts in most area of HRB under 1.5 degrees C warming scenario, while population exposure will be larger under 2.0 degrees C global warming scenario relative to 1986-2005. The additional 0.5 degrees C from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C will obviously increase the drought risks, especially in the southern and central HRB. Considering the projections that more drought risks might exist under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario than in the 1.5 degrees C level, a perspective to keep the increase in global mean temperature below 2.0 degrees C and limit it to 1.5 degrees C, has far-reaching implications to socioeconomic development in the HRB.

However, little is known about the grain-size characteristics of peaty sediments and their environmental significance. In order to study these phenomena in detail, two sections from the Hani and Gushantun peatlands in the Changbai Mountain Area were cored and sub-sampled. Based on reliable calibrated AMS C-14 ages, we established grain size variations in the peat cores since 15.6 ka cal. BP. Our results showed that the peaty sediments in the Changbai Mountains are mainly composed of silt. Moreover, the grain size component, which is related to paleoclimate variables, can be classified into three groups based on the "Grain size class vs. standard deviation" method. These sensitive grain size components are < 37.0 mm (Component 1 or C1), 37.0e497.8 mm (Component 2 or C2) and > 497.8 mm (Component 3 or C3). C1 comprises the finest silt in the peaty sediment and is mainly conveyed by the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), whereas C2 is transported into the peatland by surface runoff related to the enhancement of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). C3 is conveyed in saltation and bed-load mode by strong surface runoff linked to high-energy flow caused by a strong EASM, and perhaps is an indicator of extreme rainfall events in the Changbai Mountains. Our results suggest that the study region was dominated by a cold/dry environment during the late-glacial period under a strong EAWM. However, there was a marked climatic shift from an EAWM-dominated cold/dry climate to an EASM-dominated more mesic environment during the early Holocene. Increased percentage of C2 in peat cores during the Holocene Optimum (9.0-4.5 ka) indicates abundant rainfall in the study region (even with extreme rainfall events) as a result of a significant enhancement of the EASM. Weak monsoon events occurred at 10.5 ka, 9.2 ka, 8.2 ka, 7.2 ka, 6.2ka, 5.5 ka and 4.2 ka shown by sharp decreases in C2, agreeing with the stalagmite delta O-18 records in China. The results obtained from environmentally sensitive grain-size component records are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records in the East Asian monsoon area, substantiating the regional climate patterns and monsoon evolution since late-glacial time. Because intensity of the East Asian monsoon is likely responsible for the grain-size change in the peat samples, the grain size components in peat samples may be used for reconstructions of past environmental conditions and of variability in the East Asian monsoon.

Geomorphology and age of the Marocche di Dro rock avalanches (Trentino, Italy)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Cosmogenic Cl-36 exposure dating; Landslide; Rock slope failure; Sarca River Valley; Alps; Holocene	LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; EASTERN ALPS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUND MOTION; SOUTHERN ALPS; SWISS ALPS; LANDSLIDE ACTIVITY; COSMOGENIC CL-36; MASS MOVEMENTS; EXPOSURE AGES	The Marocche di Dro deposits in the lower Sarca Valley are some of the most distinctive rock avalanche deposits of the Alps. We use geomorphology and cosmogenic Cl-36 exposure dating of boulders to divide the Marocche di Dro deposits into two rock avalanche bodies; the Marocca Principale to the north and the Kas to the south. The deposits were previously undated and had been mapped as up to five different events. The largest event Marocca Principale, which comprises an estimated 1000 10(6) m(3) of predominantly Rotzo Formation limestones, occurred 5300 +/- 860 yr ago. The release area is located mainly in the alcove between Mt. Casale and Mt. Granzoline, but likely extends all the way to Mt. Brento. The Kas event took place 1080 +/- 160 yr ago with detachment below Mt. Brento. The Kas debris, with an estimated volume of 300 10(6) m(3), buried the southern third of the Marocca Principale deposit. Kas presents a barren, stark landscape dominated by house-sized Tovel Member Rotzo Formation boulders bearing distinctive chert lenses. Both the extreme relief of the rock wall (more than 1300 m) and the tectonic setting predispose the range front to massive failure. For the two events, initially translational movement likely quickly evolved into complex failure and massive collapse. Run-out across the valley of several kilometers and run-up on the opposite slope of hundreds of meters followed. A summary of all dated and large historical landslides in the Alps underlines the periods of enhanced slope activity discussed in the literature: 10-9 kyr, 5-3 kyr, and 2-1 kyr, the latter especially for the Southern Alps. No deposits of the first temporal cluster are found at Marocche di Dro. The age of Marocca Principale at 5300 +/- 860 yr suggests occurrence during the second period. Failure may have been related to the shift to wetter, colder climate at the transition from the middle to the late Holocene. Nevertheless, a seismic trigger cannot be ruled out. For the Kas rock avalanche at 1080 +/- 160 yr ago we implicate the "Middle Adige Valley" (1046 CE) earthquake as trigger. Its epicentral distance is much closer to the Sarca Valley in comparison to that of the Verona earthquake (1117 CE). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This New rIsk assessment methodology for Cultural HEritage protection (NICHE) is specifically addressed to the protection of cultural heritage housed in museums, galleries and archives. At the present stage of development, our proposal can be considered as a "relative risk assessment methodology" for the environmental risks to cultural heritage, as are many other methodologies for the risk assessment of works of art. However, NICHE is grounded in a new general definition of risk; it is inserted in a more general and wider conceptual framework, as far as the definition of risk is concerned. In addition, although it is a relative risk assessment methodology, NICHE takes explicitly into account the effects of microclimatic conditions on the works of art, based on the current scientific knowledge and requirements reported in international norms. Here the NICHE approach is applied to the results of two measurement campaigns carried out in 2014 over two different periods, considered "extreme" from the climatic point of view, in the Classense Library of Ravenna (Italy), a famous historical library which houses many books of great value. In these measurement campaigns, various indoor environments were characterized. Even though we focus our attention mainly on the risks related to effects of the microclimatic environment on the works of art, future extensions to other classes of risks, such as structural, related to usage, arising from natural phenomena (earthquakes, floods, storms...), infesting agents (pests, insects, moulds...), technical malfunctions, etc., can be easily performed. In fact, all situations where the effects of the sources of risk on the targets of interest can be described with an S shaped function (for example, a Dose-Response Curve, a Probit or a Logit models) can be treated with the NICHE approach, grounded in the comparison with threshold reference values reported in the technical/scientific literature and norms.

This was accomplished by statistically analyzing data from 26 meteorological stations along with monthly mean geopotential height, wind fields at 500 hPa, SLP data and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set. The variation of large scale atmospheric circulation has contributed greatly to regional warming, especially via the increasing geopotential height. Regional warming is further caused by increased anticyclonic circulation in the summer and increased anomalous cyclonic circulation and westerly currents in winter. The strong convergence of water vapor in part explained the precipitation increase. Additionally, warm and wet flow moving to the north and west brought more precipitation under the strong western pacific subtropical high. Moreover, precipitation and precipitation extremes showed positive anomaly in the La Nina I and El Nino I years, whereas they displayed negative anomalies in the La Nina II and El Nino II years.

High-resolution paleoclimatology of the Santa Barbara Basin during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and early Little Ice Age based on diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages in Kasten core SPR0901-02KC	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM)	MAR 03-06, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA			Diatom; Silicoflagellate; Medieval Warm; Little Ice Age; Santa Barbara Basin; Upwelling	GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; NORTH PACIFIC; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; GUAYMAS BASIN; PHYTOPLANKTON; CIRCULATION; OSCILLATION; PATTERNS; HISTORY	Diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages documented in a high-resolution time series spanning 800 to 1600 (AD) in varved sediment recovered in Kasten core SPR0901-02KC (34 degrees 16.845' N, 120 degrees 02.332' W, water depth 588 m) from the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) reveal that SBB surface water conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the early part of the Little Ice Age (LIA) were not extreme by modern standards, mostly falling within one standard deviation of mean conditions during the pre anthropogenic interval of 1748-1900. No clear differences between the character of MCA and the early LIA conditions are apparent. During intervals of extreme droughts identified by terrigenous proxy scanning XRF analyses, diatom and silicoflagellate proxies for coastal upwelling typically exceed one standard deviation above mean values for 1748-1900, supporting the hypothesis that droughts in southern California are associated with cooler (or La Nina-like) sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Increased percentages of diatoms transported downslope generally coincide with intervals of increased siliciclastic flux to the SBB identified by scanning XRF analyses. Diatom assemblages suggest only two intervals of the MCA (at similar to 897 to 922 and similar to 1151-1167) when proxy SSTs exceeded one standard deviation above mean values for 1748 to 1900. Conversely, silicoflagellates imply extreme warm water events only at similar to 830 to 860 (early MCA) and similar to 1360 to 1370 (early LIA) that are not supported by the diatom data. Silicoflagellates appear to be more suitable for characterizing average climate during the 5 to 11 year-long sample intervals studied in the SPR0901-02KC core than diatoms, probably because diatom relative abundances may be dominated by seasonal blooms of a particular year.

Its hydrology and limited water resources depend on storms and floods. Therefore, the hydrology and flow regime in the Swakop River basin determines the availability of water for human use. In this study we present a millennia-long record of extreme floods, using paleoflood hydrological methods and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages. The record includes 44 large floods ranging in date from the late Pleistocene to the present. The oldest six to eight floods are dated from the late Pleistocene to the mid-Holocene (between 14,900 +/- 1700 and 5100 +/- 620 years ago), with calculated peak discharges of 550-1280 m(3) s(-1). Eighteen floods, eleven of which were between 1000 and 1600 m(3) s(-1), occurred between 740 +/- 90 and 190 +/- 10 years ago. Additional 17 later floods occurred between about AD 1850 and 1963, with peak discharges between 100 and 1000 m(3) s(-1). The historical record which partly parallels the latter period recorded 17 large floods during the period 1893-1963. Flood frequency analysis (FFA) of the combined systematically gaged record (1963-2003) and the paleoflood record since AD 1270 (740 +/- 90 years, the most complete record), was applied using the maximum likelihood method. A two-component extreme value distribution (TCEV) estimates the 1% annual exceedance probability magnitude, using only the systematic gaged record at 520 m(3) s(-1). The combined paleoflood, historical, and gage records resulted in a much larger magnitudes for the 1% annual exceedance probability flood magnitude of 1320-1350 m(3) s(-1). The 0.1% annual exceedance probability magnitude is estimated at 770 m(3) s(-1) and 2100-2150 m(3) s(-1), respectively. The hydroclimatic interpretation of this paleoflood record is complex, due to the discontinuity of the record. During the late Holocene, our flood data show three intervals differing in their flood regime: (1) 1280 +/- 80 to 740 +/- 90 years BP, with one extraordinary flood (>200 m(3) s(-1)) about every 180 years; (2) 740 +/- 90 to 200 +/- 45 C-14 years BP, with one large flood per 80 years; and (3) 200 +/- 45 C-14 years BP to AD1963, with one large flood per 7 years. Interval 2 represents large floods, probably related to the transition from a drier climate to the colder and probably wetter climate of the Little Ice Age (LIA). The third period relates to the end of the LIA and to a wetter period of the 19th and early 20th centuries in which more rainfall in the Kalahari and Namib Deserts and many historical floods were documented. The presence of three distinct calcretes rich in calcified rhizoliths at one of the sites, two of which were dated by OSL to 13.2 +/- 1.9 ka and 8.8 +/- 1.0 ka, indicates, at least locally, higher moisture availability than in the current semiarid climate; the presence of denser vegetation can be associated with increased groundwater seepage and wetter climatic conditions.

Wood parameters measured include tree-ring width, latewood width, earlywood width, cell lumen area, cell width, cell wall thickness, modelled wood density, as well as stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. We evaluated the relationships between different parameters and determined the value of the dataset for climate reconstructions. Correlation analyses revealed that carbon isotope ratios are influenced by cell parameters determining cell size, whereas oxygen isotope ratios are influenced by cell parameters determining the amount of transportable water in the xylem. A summer Uune to August) precipitation reconstruction dating back to AD 1185 was established based on tree-ring width. No long-term trends or pronounced periods with extreme high/low precipitation are recorded in our reconstruction, indicating relatively stable moisture conditions over the entire time period. By comparing the precipitation reconstruction with a summer temperature reconstruction derived from the carbon isotope chronologies, we identified summers with extreme climate conditions, i.e. warm-dry, warm-wet, cold-dry and cold-wet. Extreme climate conditions during summer months were found to influence cell parameter characteristics. Cold-wet summers promote the production of broad latewood composed of wide and thin-walled tracheids, while warm-wet summers promote the production of latewood with small thick-walled cells. The presented dataset emphasizes the potential of multi-parameter wood analysis from one tree species over long time scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study applied a novel approach by combining individual series from all sites into one NEMED master chronology. This approach retains only the series with a strong and temporally robust common signal and it improves reconstruction length. It further improved the regional character of the reconstruction by using as a target averaged gridded instrumental temperature data from a broad NEMED region (38-45 degrees N, 15-25 degrees E). Cold (e.g. 1740) and warm (e.g. 1945) extreme years and decades in the reconstruction correspond to regional instrumental and reconstructed temperature records. Some extreme periods (e. g. cold 1810s) reflect European-wide or global-scale climate conditions and can be explained by volcanic and solar forcing. Other extremes are strictly regional in scope. For example, 1976 was the coldest NEMED summer over the last 350 years, but was anomalously dry and hot in northwestern Europe and is a strong manifestation of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO). The regional NEMED summer reconstruction thus contributes to an improved understanding of regional (e.g. sNAO) vs. global-scale (i.e. external) drivers of past climate variability.

The record starts during the late Holocene sea-level rise when the terrestrial vegetation indicated wet and cool conditions. The site was a coastal bay definitely transformed into a freshwater swamp at around 3400 cal yr BP, after the rapid drawdown of sea level to its current level. Sediments and foraminiferal assemblages indicated subsequent episodes of freshwater infillings, emersion or very highenergy conditions, likely related to climatic changes and mostly controlled by ENSO variability. Between 2750 and 2000 cal yr BP, relatively dry and cool climate prevailed, while wetter conditions predominated between ca. 1800 and 900 cal yr BP. The Rhizophoraceae peak between ca. 1080 and 750 cal yr BP, coeval with the MWP, may indicate a global phenomenon. Microcharcoal particles present throughout the record increased after 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting an anthropogenic source. From ca. 750 cal yr BP the appearance of current type of vegetation marks the human impact. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, many long-term studies that utilize the remains of total charcoal in lacustrine sediments fail to demonstrate a relationship between climate change and fire activity. A new approach to reconstruct the relative-area burned based on specific types of charcoal particles (the charcoal-morphotype (CM) fire index) has shown significant correlations to recorded forest fires. Here we assess the utility of the CM derived from an analysis of charcoal morphotypes in sediment cores from Opatcho Lake (British Columbia, Canada) using two independent paleoclimate proxies over the last 400 years, and since the mid Holocene. Over the past 400 years, significant correlations between the CM fire index and independent climate reconstructions (diatom-inferred salinity, dendroclimatic reconstructions of temperature and precipitation, and reconstructions of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) range from 0.35 to 0.42. Similarly, since the mid Holocene the correlation between the CM fire index and independent proxies of past climate (diatom-inferred salinity and temperature inferences from chironomids from the southern interior of British Columbia) range from 0.70 to 0.76. These significant correlations strongly contrast with the very low and insignificant correlations between the CM fire index and total charcoal, suggesting that this approach provides paleofire information not available from traditional techniques. The CM fire index suggests that fires were at least two-and five-fold larger than those observed during the instrumental period, over the last 400 and 6000 years, respectively.

Radiocarbon dating of buried organic soils implies that the onset of talus reworking was asynchronous, and occurred before 6.6-7.0 cal. kyr BP at one site (roughly 5.0 kyr after deglaciation) but after c. 2.7 cal. kyr BP at another. A general model for talus evolution in upland Britain is proposed, based on the geomorphological, stratigraphic and dating evidence of this and earlier studies. This comprises: (1) initial accumulation of rockfall debris within a few millennia following deglaciation; (2) near-cessation of rockfall accumulation and development of gullies near the talus crest, with concomitant redistribution of eroded talus sediments on the upper slope by debris flows and slopewash; (3) downslope extension of gullies with associated erosion of both talus and overlying debris-flow and slopewash deposits, and redistribution of these sediments as slope-foot debris cones. This sequence can be explained as an intrinsic response to diminution of paraglacial rockfall inputs, and does not necessarily imply any change in climate, frequency of extreme rainstorm events or other extrinsic effects.

Managing these demands requires monitoring of the dynamic interaction between cultural heritage, natural environment and contemporary society. Collaboration between research, management and governance is therefore necessary if we are to reconcile the competing demands of living with heritage. The Angkor World Heritage Site in Cambodia epitomizes the challenge and is a test case for the management of World Heritage in developing countries. A joint Cambodian and international programme is now developing collaboration policies, monitoring approaches and time-based, geographical information systems (GIS) for site management, in the context of the recent re-definition of the extent and the nature of Angkor by the surveys of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient and the Greater Angkor Project. The focus is on participatory planning, the role of mapping in engaging local communities in management processes and the relationship between diverse heritage values at the local, national and international scale.

These sediments provide a record of sea-level change, alluvial and slope response to late Quaternary climatic changes and millennial scale occurrences of various natural hazards. Drying of climate and consequent retraction of rainforest into refugia just prior to and after the Last Glacial Maximum resulted in the construction of extensive high-level alluvial fans and slope deposits which were incised following the amelioration of climate during the early Holocene. The Holocene sea-level record of the region is best shown by coral micro-atolls which suggest that hydro-isostatic rebound following flooding of the continental shelf resulted in a sea-level fall of approximately 1 m since 5.5 ka. Coastal progradation following sea-level stabilisation at approximately 6 ka has occurred with the deposition of sandy beach ridges and cheniers on a mud substrate. These and other ridges on offshore islands along the Great Barrier Reef were likely a result of deposition by storm surge and waves during tropical cyclones. These millennial scale records highlight that extreme intensity tropical cyclones occur an order of magnitude more frequently than that suggested by the short (similar to 100 yr) historical record of tropical cyclones from the region.

These patterns yield abundant winter snowfall and anomalously cool summer temperatures. We assume that atmosphere/ocean boundary conditions during the last interglacial and today are similar. Atmospheric circulation patterns inferred from composite mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomaly fields for the extreme cold summers and wet winters are consistent with the respective composite summer 2-in temperature and winter precipitation anomaly patterns. Summer 2-m temperatures (winter precipitation rate) are strongly (weakly) correlated with North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Extreme season MSLP anomalies and associated wind stress may augment the SST anomalies via Ekman transport. The contemporary climate record over the study region shows substantial interannual variability, consistent with the lack of glaciation. The extreme cold summer/wet winter criteria for glaciation occur in the contemporary record, but are rare. Mass balance calculations using NNR demonstrate that a perennial snowfield is possible in the study region, but glacial onset requires a change in the frequency distribution of climatic events to yield a sustained (decadal) period of cold summers that preserve the winter accumulation.

Altogether 69 AMS C-14 measurements were performed on these deposits, mostly on terrestrial plant macrofossils. In several cases, plant macrofossils, aquatic animal remains (Cladoceran eggs) and bulk sediment were measured from the same depth allowing for the comparison of various sediment components in terms of their dating potential. Age-depth models were developed using both Bayesian modelling with the BACON and smooth spline curve fitting with the CLAM software. In this study Bayesian models are applied to identify outlier C-14 dates, while smooth spline models are used to model sediment accumulation age-depth relations, as these are more likely to follow natural deposition time changes of lake sediments. Changes in sediment deposition times (DT) in relation to catchment size and climate are also studied. DT varied considerably in the late glacial (LG) part of the records. The sediment sequence characterised by high deposition rates during the late glacial (DT maximum around 100-110 years cm(-1)) was defined by small catchment size (Lake Brazi, 6 ha; surface area: 0.5 ha). In contrast, much slower LG sediment deposition in the southern slope lake characterised by large catchment area (Lake Lia, 171 ha, 20 years cm(-1)), principally reflecting strong erosion in these catchment areas at times when vegetation cover was scarce. Holocene was characterised again by variable DT values, but only Lake Gales showed extreme values: 62-110 years between 10,900 and 6050 cal yr BP, followed by much slower sediment deposition in the last 6000 years (av. 29 years cm(-1)). Generally, sediment deposition times were largely dependent on the stability and vegetation cover of the slope in the case of high altitude deep lakes, while lower altitude, shallow lakes showed slower sediment deposition time in the early and mid-Holocene, when summer insolation was higher than today. This reflects that in these shallow lakes in-lake organic production probably increased with summer insolation, which was a significant driver in the rate of deposition.

However, the role of coastal flooding in the interruption of the Neolithic Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze valley, East China coast has been long contested. In this study, we used a well-dated Neolithic site (the Yushan site) close to the present coastline to demonstrate a marine drowning event at the terminal stage of the Liangzhu culture and discuss its linkage to relative sea-level rise. We analysed sedimentology, chronology, organic elemental composition, diatoms and dinoflagellate cysts for several typical profiles at the Yushan site. The field and sedimentary data provided clear evidence of a palaeo-typhoon event that overwhelmed the Yushan site at similar to 2560 BCE, which heralded a period of marine inundation and ecological deterioration at the site. We also infer an acceleration in sea-level rise at 2560-2440 BCE from the sedimentary records at Yushan, which explains the widespread signatures of coastal flooding across the south Yangtze coastal plain at that time. The timing of this mid-Holocene coastal flooding coincided with the sudden disappearance of the advanced and widespread Liangzhu culture along the lower Yangtze valley. We infer that extreme events and flooding accompanying accelerated sea-level rise were major causes of vulnerability for prehistoric coastal societies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Was the drought really responsible? Assessing statistical relationships between climate extremes and cultural transitions	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Monte Carlo methods; Climate extremes; Coupled human-natural systems; Southwest US		It is commonplace to assert causal relationships between episodes of extreme climate with dramatic cultural shifts. We explore the problem of statistically assessing the correspondence between episodes of extreme climate (such as droughts) and cultural events (such as depopulation) they are purported to explain. In order to do this: 1) We describe a method that permits the objective identification of climate extremes in a way that is independent of their supposed causal outcomes; 2) We discuss how we identify and date cultural transitions of interest; 3) We explore a variety of decision rules for determining whether or not there is a match between a given extreme climate interval and the interval during which a transition began: and 4) We propose an intuitive Monte Carlo approach to statistically assess the observed correspondence between the climate extremes and the cultural transitions. Our application does not indicate statistical support for a linkage between intervals of extreme climate and major transitions in any of the seven cultural traditions in the Southwest US that we examined.

This study investigates the effect of global warming on temperature and precipitation trends in the Yellow, Yangtze and Pearl River basins (the Three Basins) of China over the past 58 years (1956-2013). Over this time period, the mean warming rate in the Three Basins (0.22 degrees C/10 yr) was close to that for the global land surface (0.21 degrees C/10 yr). However, the warming rate showed high spatial variability across the study region, ranging from 0.05 degrees C/10 yr to 0.49 degrees C/10 yr. These rates tend to increase with latitude and elevation and toward very large cities (e.g., Shanghai). The warming rate in the Three Basins varied by season, it was lower in summer (0.14 degrees C/10 yr) and higher in winter (0.29 degrees C/10 yr). In spite of the warming trend, no statistically significant increase or decrease in precipitation was found for the Three Basins over the past 58 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The archaeological site Estanque de Tormentas de Butarque H-02 in Villaverde, Madrid, in central Spain, recently attributed to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, provides new data on cold small-vertebrate assemblages. Quantitative climate reconstruction and habitat weighting methods applied to the herpetofaunal assemblage reconstruct the terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions that prevailed in central Spain during the penultimate glacial (MIS 6). During MIS 6, the climate was colder (-3.0 degrees C) and slightly wetter (+122.8 mm) than present in the study area. This confirms that temperature variations were not extreme and precipitation was sufficient in southern Mediterranean Europe for the persistence of temperate trees. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction suggests a large representation of dry environments on the overlying plateau, together with a probable corridor of humid meadows and woodlands along the river where the site is located.

Here we report a bidecadally-resolved New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) tree-ring sequence spanning two millennia that preserves a record of atmospheric radiocarbon (C-14) during ice-rafted debris event Heinrich Event 3 (HE3) in the North Atlantic and Antarctic Isotope Maximum 4 (AIM4) in the Southern Hemisphere. Using C-14 in the marine Cariaco Basin and Be-10 preserved in Greenland ice, the kauri C-14 sequence allows us to precisely align sequences across this period. We observe no significant difference between atmospheric and marine C-14 records during HE3, suggesting no stratification of surface waters and collapse in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Instead our results support recent evidence for a weakened AMOC across at least two millennia of the glacial period. Our work adds to a growing body of literature confirming that Heinrich events are not the cause of stadial cooling and suggests changes in the AMOC were not the primary driver of antiphase temperature trends between the hemispheres. Decadally-resolved C-14 in ancient kauri offers a powerful new (and complementary) approach to polar ice core CH4 alignment for testing hypotheses of abrupt and extreme climate change.

The ongoing excavation works yielded 445 fossil remains including cold-adapted elements as woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), two species of special interest since they are poorly represented in the Iberian Pleistocene. The woolly rhinoceros assemblage comprises numerous unusually well preserved elements as one mandible, one femur and one partially preserved skull. The steppe bison (Bison priscus) is the dominant species in the assemblage, providing an outstanding collection of well-preserved elements that comprises two skulls and numerous limb bones. Carnivores are represented by a partial skeleton (including a complete skull) of spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Radiocarbon AMS analyses of the fossil assemblage yielded two dates of 44.5 and 37.6 Cal ka BP, corresponding to MIS 3, a phase of climatic instability characterized by fast climate changes, from extreme cold to temperate conditions. These dates are coeval with the maximum registered expansion of the mammoth fauna in the Iberian Peninsula and with the onset of glacier retreat in the Cantabrian Mountain Range, after the last local glacial maximum. Geomorphological and sedimentological evidence suggests that bone accumulation took place as the result of gravity processes in a collapse doline, filled by a chaotic accumulation of calcareous boulders, pebbles and bone fragments, embedded in a silteclay matrix, which points to a possible natural-trap origin of this fossil assemblage. The exceptional well preservation of the fossils, as well as the lack of any evidence of human or carnivore activity, supports this idea. Palynological analyses suggest an open landscape under variable climatic conditions, responsible for the fluctuating presence/absence of the arboreal taxa. The predominance of steppe and, to a lesser extent, xeric herbaceous plants indicate very dry conditions, whereas presence of mesophilous forest taxa implies the existence of a refuge area at distance. This open and dry landscape, developed in a karst area with a relative smooth relief, is consistent with the occurrence of the large mammal species steppe bison, woolly rhinoceros and reindeer. Faunal and pollen analyses, hence, provides a new evidence for the development of cold and dry steppe-like environments in NW Iberia during MIS 3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In this article, I use the archaeozoological record from late Pleistocene Iberia to show that humans responded to late glacial climate extremes in ways specific to the macro-bioclimatic regions in which they lived. Nestedness, cluster (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages [UPGMA]), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses suggest that in Mediterranean bioclimates, which were less impacted by glacial extremes, people implemented a general broad-spectrum hunting strategy. In the colder, more climatically extreme "Euro-Siberian" region, the data suggest a diversity of hunting adaptations, likely shaped by specifics of local environments. While technological change and increasing global connectivity since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have moderated the direct impact of climate change on humans, these analyses - and others - suggest that local management rather than global decision-making will be key to human adaptations in environments most strongly affected by modern climate change.

Here we report four new tree-ring series which in addition to previous work represent some 5312 years across Oxygen Isotope Stage 3, a period during which human evolution, migration and extinction took place against a backdrop of extreme and abrupt global climate and environmental change. We compare our radiocarbon-dated series against three different calibration datasets and find considerable differences in the wiggle-matched solutions, demonstrating the difficulty in undertaking high-precision correlation between ice, marine and terrestrial sequences. One way around the apparent impasse is the use of Be-10 in the Greenland and Antarctic ice cores to precisely link to kauri C-14 from which a decadally/bidecadally-resolved floating 'calibration' dataset can be generated.

Response to precipitation was significant only for July of the current year (0.23), while a clear temperature response to the May-August period was identified, with July having by far the highest correlation (-0.47). When combined, June-July temperatures had the highest correlation of all tested combinations (r=-0.63), explaining almost 40% of the tree-ring width variability. The test of the climate signal temporal stability using a 31-year running correlation highlighted the very stable relationship between tree-ring indices and June-July temperatures. The spatial extent of the regional Pinus nigra chronology tested, using a field correlation function, showed very high spatial correlation over a large part of the Balkan Peninsula and even southern Italy. Based on high explained variance between tree-ring indices and June-July temperatures and significant values of reduction of error (RE) and coefficient of efficiency statistics (CE; 0.62 and 0.25 in the calibration period), a linear model was developed, with June-July temperatures reconstructed for the 1583-2010 period. Our reconstruction and identified extreme years were compared with various temperature, drought and precipitation reconstructions from nearby regions, as well as data from documentary archives. We confirmed a high degree of similarity of our reconstruction with other reconstructions and documentary data.

In this paper, we describe how Australian palaeo-environmental science is improving environmental understanding through local studies and regional syntheses that inform us about past conditions, extreme conditions and altered ecosystem states. Australian innovations in ecosystem services research and palaeo-environmental science contribute in five important contexts: discussions about environmental understanding and management objectives, improving access to information, improved knowledge about the dynamics of ecosystem services, increasing understanding of environmental processes and resource availability, and engaging interdisciplinary approaches to manage ecosystem services. Knowledge of the past is an important starting point for setting present and future resource management objectives, anticipating consequences of trade-offs, sharing risk and evaluating and monitoring the ongoing availability of ecosystem services. Palaeo-environmental information helps reframe discussions about desirable futures and collaborative efforts between scientists, planners, managers and communities. However, further steps are needed to translate the ecosystem services concept into ecosystem services policy and tangible management objectives and actions that are useful, feasible and encompass the range of benefits to people from ecosystems. We argue that increased incorporation of palaeo-environmental information into policy and decision-making is needed for evidence-based adaptive management to enhance sustainability of ecosystem functions and reduce long-term risks.

The belt consists of a low-lying medial alluvial plain surrounded by hills more than 50 m a.s.l. (above sea level). The Neolithic cities within this belt occupied three distinct topographies, the highlands of alluvial plains, the lower foothills, and the surrounding hills. All the cities were situated adjacent to the lowest level tributaries or smallest lakes, and had complex trench defense systems, with rivers and lakes interlinking the trenches, and most of the cities had defensive moats. Construction peaks of defensive fortifications occurred during the Daxi (4550-3050 BC) and Qujialing cultures (3050-2650 BC), while most Neolithic cities were abandoned in the late Shijiahe period (similar to 2250 BC). Based on assessments on the locality, age, construction, and the detailed information on the geographical characteristics of the Neolithic cities, the sites of Neolithic cities were tightly associated with the development history of East civilization, and the rise of the cities is well correlated with the warm and humid climate in mid-Holocene (similar to 5.2 cal. ka BP, or similar to 3250 BC), while the decline of the ancient cities is related with the dry and cold climate in mid-late Holocene (similar to 4.2 cal. ka BP, or similar to 2250 BC). The development and decline of these cities were also well linked with water accessibility, topography, and the occurrence of droughts, floods and other extreme events during the mid-Holocene. Such environment conditions and climate changes played significant roles for the ancient people to determine the location, structure, and morphology of the cities. Although the military considerations were also important, we cannot simply consider the prehistoric city construction in the middle Yangtze River was a passive defense against foreign invasion.

Climatic-orographic-hydrologic processes in the Qinling Mountains were assessed through model simulation from proposed hydrodynamic gradient model and hydrological hazard index model combined with MM5 model (PSU/NCAR, 2005) and HEC-HMS/RAS (USACE, 2008) model. Results show that climate change is key contributor to flood extreme events, and the Qinling Mountains has increased risk of rainstorm-flood extreme events. The hydrogeomorphological gradient has strong north south gradient distribution due to orographic effects of the Qinling Mountains. Climate change impacts on hydrogeomorphological processes are dominated by short and severe rainstorms. High-frequency heavy rain regions are located in steep topographic gradients, such as the north south valleys and windward slopes of higher elevations in the Qinling Mountains. The hydrogeomorphological consequences intensify the occurrence of localized extreme flash floods and accelerated erosion, altering flooding routing in the upper Hanjiang River basin. Flood routing is likely to be controlled by topographic rainfall for shorter periods (5-year and 10-year), and by climate change for longer periods (50-year and 100-year). Rainstorms and sediment gravity accumulation are the main causes of hazards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Nearly half of the species in New Zealand's pre-human avifauna are now extinct, including all nine species of large, flightless moa (Ayes: Dinornithiformes). The abundance of moa in early archaeological sites demonstrates the significance of these megaherbivores in the diet of the first New Zealanders. Combining moa assemblage data, based on DNA identification of eggshell and bone, with morphological identification of bone (literature and museum catalogued specimens), we present the most comprehensive audit of moa to date from several significant 13th-15th century AD archaeological deposits across the east coast of the South Island. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was amplified from 251 of 323 (78%) eggshell fragments and 22 of 27 (88%) bone samples, and the analyses revealed the presence of four moa species: Anomalopteryx didiformis; Dinornis robustus; Emeus crassus and Euryapteryx curtus. The mtDNA, along with polymorphic microsatellite markers, enabled an estimate of the minimum number of individual eggs consumed at each site. Remarkably, in one deposit over 50 individual eggs were identified - a number that likely represents a considerable proportion of the total reproductive output of moa in the area and emphasises that human predation of all life stages of moa was,,intense. Molecular sexing was conducted on bones (n = 11). Contrary to previous ancient DNA studies from natural sites that consistently report an excess of female moa, we observed an excess of males (2.7:1), suggestive that males were preferential targets. This could be related to different behaviour between the two highly size-dimorphic sexes in moa. Lastly, we investigated the moa species from recovered skeletal and eggshell remains from seven Wairau Bar burials, and identified the presence of only the larger species of moa, E. curtus and D. robustus.

Although prolonged periods of aridity have been invoked as one mechanism for their formation, Native American land use has also been hypothesized as a driver of tree island development. Using pollen assemblages from head and near tail sediments collected on two tree islands and documented archeological data, the relative roles of Native Americans, climate variability, and recent water-management practices in forming and structuring Everglades tree islands are examined. The timing of changes recorded in the pollen record indicates that tree islands developed from sawgrass marshes similar to 3800 cal. yr BP, prior to human occupation. Major tree island expansion, recorded near tail sediments, occurred similar to 1000 years after initial tree island formation. Comparison of the timing of pollen assemblages with other proxy records indicates that tree island expansion is related to regional and global aridity correlated with southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Local fire associated with droughts may also have influenced tree island expansion. This work suggests that Native American occupation did not significantly influence tree island formation and that the most important factors governing tree island expansion are extreme hydrologic events due to droughts and intense twentieth century water management.

This sector is characterized by numerous, extensive landslide masses and there is evidence of their reactivation during the last century. The instability phenomena can be attributed to landslides with complex kinematics classifiable as rock slump and rock topple, rock slide and rock fall, and rock fall and rock flow. They have involved hamlets and communication routes, with observable damage to man-made structures and terraced agricultural terrain, including collapses and deformations of the dry-stone walls. The geomorphological surveys, the boreholes and the monitoring activity have shown that several landslides are active, with movement rates of some cm/year. With the presence of predisposing factors relating to the structural lithology and geomorphology of the rocky slopes, the triggering causes of the gravitational movements are attributable to extreme heavy rainfall and to wave cutting, often with concomitant action on the part of both. The study offers a contribution to encourage concrete efforts to continue the monitoring of this area; the overall objective would entail the planning of general stabilization measures, or at least measures to reduce evident geomorphological risks, also taking into account the remarkable environmental value and qualities of this coastal sector.

Our results show a more complex relationship between the distribution of archaeological sites and areas of low collagen degradation than was previously identified for Africa. Several factors appear to overshadow the link between collagen degradation and site location over Asia including the size of the continent. environmental extremes, taphonomy and excavation bias. However, in Southern Asia a relationship does exist between collagen loss and site location. with archaeological sites found in areas of relatively low collagen degradation. In this region the model may represent a profitable way of highlighting areas suitable for further archaeological research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Even though the uppermost regions of the mountains are also influenced by earthquakes and typhoon rains, present geomorphic activity is low. Investigations based oil field work and air photo study in Nanhuta Shan (3742 m) and Yushan (3952 m) and the analysis of climate data indicate the presence of a periglacial belt with a lower limit at 3600-3700 m. The upper limit of the periglacial belt in Taiwan is not met. Ground temperature measurements in Nanhuta Shan show that freeze-thaw activity at 3560111 during the winter is restricted to the top few centimetres of the ground and the maximum frost depth is similar to 25cm.The only indicator landforms within the periglacial belt are smooth slopes. The high relief energy and a lack of fine material account for the absence of other periglacial landforms. Relict solifluction terraces, debris cones and slope failures found between 3400 and 3600 in in Nanhuta Shan are strong evidence for a period of increased slope activity during the Holocene, which in two cases were dated by OSL to approx. 3 ka. At least one solifluction unit developed during a cooler phase between 3 ka and today. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Palaeoenvironments of the last Neanderthals in SW Europe (MIS 3): Cova del Coll Verdaguer (Barcelona, NE of Iberian Peninsula)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Late Pleistocene; MIS 3; Cova del Coll Verdaguer; Palaeoenvironment; Iberian Peninsula	TEIXONERES CAVE MOIA; MILLENNIAL-SCALE VARIABILITY; UPPER PALEOLITHIC TRANSITION; ELECTRON-SPIN-RESONANCE; DEER CERVUS-ELAPHUS; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; ABRIC-ROMANI; HALF-LIVES; U-SERIES; CLIMATIC VARIABILITY	Marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3) was characterised by marked oscillations of extreme cold episodes with very short warm events during the stadial, and several regional differences have been recorded in the ice cores and marine deposits. The aim of this study is to reconstruct this period by evaluating both terrestrial and regional responses. Cova del Coll Verdaguer, a site located on the Iberian Peninsula, preserves a sedimentary deposit dated to between 34 and 56 1<a BP and provides an opportunity for evaluating the impact of climate changes on the regional landmass during a period that coincided with the last Neanderthal population on the Iberian Peninsula. Several dating methods, including U-series, electron spin resonance, amino acid racemization and radiocarbon (14C), were applied to the site and the ages obtained show good agreement. The biotic evidence obtained is substantial, comprising floristic data from palynology and charcoal analysis, and faunal data from large and small mammals, birds and gastropods. Environmental reconstruction points to an initially open meadow landscape at the base of the sequence (similar to 56 ka) that progressively changes to a woodland environment dominated by conifers (similar to 34 ka). The presence of few thermophilous taxa, in contrast with lower latitudes of the Iberian Peninsula, is also detected. The environmental conditions of mid-altitude, Mediterranean, limestone mountains for the last Neanderthal populations appear to have been dominated by a forested landscape comprising boreal or mixed coniferous forest, characterised by a low usable biomass with poor comestible plant resources and dispersed herbivore populations.

Glacial-interglacial climate changes recorded by debris flow fan deposits, Owens Valley, California	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article							HOURLY PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; SOUTHWESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; FISH SPRINGS FAULT; FREE-SURFACE FLOWS; SIERRA-NEVADA; ALLUVIAL FANS; LANDSCAPE RESPONSE; WHITE MOUNTAINS; GRAIN-SIZE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA	It is hotly debated whether and how climate changes are recorded by terrestrial stratigraphy. Basin sediments produced by catchment-alluvial fan systems may record past climate over a variety of timescales, and could offer unique information about how climate controls sedimentation. Unfortunately, there are fundamental uncertainties about how climatic variables such as rainfall and temperature translate into sedimentological signals. Here, we examine 35 debris flow fan surfaces in Owens Valley, California, that record deposition throughout the past 125,000 years, during which climate has varied significantly. We show that the last full glacial-interglacial cycle is recorded with high fidelity by the grain size distributions of the debris flow deposits. These flows transported finer sediment during the cooler glacial climate, and became systematically coarser-grained as the climate warmed and dried. We explore the physical mechanisms that might explain this signal, and rule out changes in sediment supply through time. Instead, we propose that grain size records past changes in storm intensity, which is responsible for debris flow initiation in this area and is decoupled from average rainfall rates. This is supported by an exponential Clausius-Clapeyron-style scaling between grain size and temperature, and also reconciles with climate dynamics and the initiation of debris flows. The fact that these alluvial fans exhibit a strong, sustained sensitivity to orbital climate changes sheds new light on how eroding landscapes and their sedimentary products respond to climatic forcing. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of threshold-controlled events, such as storms and debris flows, in driving erosion and sedimentation at the Earth's surface in response to climate change.

QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Extreme precipitation regimes; Climate change; Yellow Sea western coast	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE EXTREMES; URBAN-GROWTH; CHINA; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; URBANIZATION	Based on dataset at 12 meteorological stations across the Yellow Sea western coast (YSWC) during 1951 2011, spatiotemporal variations of extreme precipitation events are analyzed by the methods of linear regression, Mann Kendall test and wavelet analysis. Results show that the majority of precipitation indices exhibit decreasing trends excepting for consecutive dry days (CDD) and simple daily intensity index (SDII), which display increasing trends in most of locations, indicating that the rainfall becomes more concentrated and the intensity of precipitation increases in the last decades. Trends in extreme precipitation indices have mixed patterns over the intersection regions between Shandong and Jiangsu, where the increases in drought-flood disasters may be dramatic. Regional extreme precipitation indices in CDD and SDII show significant positive trends even though the annual total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT) has a significant decline trend, this suggests that the increases in intensity of precipitation cannot counteract the decreases in other wet-related indices and the YSWC tends to be drier conditions. The temporal variability in seasonal indices of max 1-day precipitation (RXI day) and max 5-day precipitation (RX5day) shows that winter is becoming the wettest season. And the abrupt shift of precipitation regime in the later 1970s is detected for several indices. Factor analysis indicates that the changes in precipitation extremes, rather moderate rainfall, are of great contributions to the variability of annual total rainfall. There are multiple and overlapping cycles for most precipitation indices during 1951-2011, suggesting variations of time and frequency, while the 12-15-year cycle is prevailing for some indices. Further analyses indicate that global warming, coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, and urbanization are three major forcing factors affecting the variations in precipitation extremes over the YSWC during last decades.

The pollen record of GeoB9311, retrieved offshore of the Zambezi River mouth, indicates glacial-interglacial changes in the vegetation of southern East Africa with enhanced forests in the coastal area during interglacials, more Afromontane forest and ericaceous bushland during glacials and an increase in mopane woodland during the transitional periods. C-4 swamps, probably with papyrus, might have spread during the more humid phases of the glacial, while mangroves responded sensitively to changes in sea level. The spread of open ericaceous bushland and Afromontane forest during glacials is found for most of Southern Africa with the exception of the extreme south and southwest regions. In contrast to the western part of the continent, forest and woodland in East Africa did not completely disappear during the glacial. It seems that on a regional scale climatic perturbations of the vegetation are less severe than in West Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Dupont, L.

Magnitude and frequency of wet years under a megadrought climate in the western Great Basin, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Great Basin; Interannual variability; Megadrought; Paleohydrology; Terminal lake; Western United States	ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; NORTH-AMERICA; SIERRA-NEVADA; HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; CALIFORNIA; DROUGHT; EXTREME; WINTER	Megadroughts are not devoid of interannual precipitation variability. However, the frequency and magnitude of occasional wet years must be limited in order to be consistent with geologic evidence indicating terminal lake lowstands during past megadroughts. We present a series of hydrologic model simulations of Walker Lake, a western Great Basin terminal lake, where varying return intervals of increased cool-season (October-April) precipitation are superimposed upon a megadrought climate. Estimated megadrought lowstands are achieved with wetter years returning every 5-10 years. Total cool season moisture transport derived from the 20th Century Reanalysis between 1895 and 2012 A.D. was positively correlated with cool-season precipitation during the corresponding year (0.49, p < 0.01). Daily moisture transport exceeding the 95th percentile is used as a surrogate for atmospheric river events. Wetter (drier) years had a greater (lesser) fraction of total cool season transport occurring on atmospheric river days, indicating their important role in driving western Great Basin hydroclimate variability.

The precipitation concentration is found to increase in the Crimean Mountains region in the winter season, but in the summer season the precipitation concentration is characterized by uniform distribution. Linear trends of the winter and summer precipitation concentration during the last 58 years are predominantly negative over Crimea. The maximum values of precipitation level in the winter season are typical for the Crimean Mountains region. In the summer season, values of precipitation change insignificantly. The number of days with extreme precipitation exhibits decreasing trends in the winter season over the territory of Crimea. In the summer season, the number of days with extreme precipitation in south-eastern part of Crimea has increasing trends. The negative PDO phase in the winter season was found to accompany increased precipitation concentration (up to 11%) all over Crimea and by decreased concentration (up to 4%) in the summer season in central, southern, and eastern regions of Crimea. The number of extreme precipitation days in the winter season is up to 30% higher in the negative PDO phase over the whole territory of Crimea, while in the summer it is up to 60% lower in the south-eastern part of peninsula.

Hydrological Modeling and Prehistoric Settlement on Santa Rosa Island, California, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SOCIAL COMPLEXITY; NORTH-AMERICA; SOUTHERN; EVOLUTION; DROUGHT; MAYA; RESPONSES; OVERCAST; FOG	Fresh water availability was an important variable that influenced prehistoric human settlement on California's northern Channel Islands. Previous attempts to understand settlement on the islands use watershed size as a proxy for water at canyon mouths. In semi-arid regions, this approach has limitations because streams may lose much or all of their flow to groundwater. We developed a distributed hydrological model for Santa Rosa Island that incorporates geospatial and temporal data for climate (precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, temperature), soils, vegetation, and topography to simulate the complex land-surface-groundwater behavior of island hydrology for hypothetical wet, dry, and median centuries. Our simulations show that water flow is greatest in drainages on the northwest and east coasts of the island. This correlates with some of the earliest and most persistent settlement on the island. During the most extreme droughts of the last 2000 years during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (1150-600 cal BP), island populations contracted to a small number of large coastal villages. We argue that this was related in part to the greater availability of surface water at these locations. This study expands the theoretical and methodological scope of past studies that have applied hydrological simulation to archaeological investigations. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Holocene flood frequency reconstruction from speleothems in northern Spain	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Cave flooding; Stalagmite records; Flood events; Holocene; Karst	VARVED SEDIMENTS; CAVE; VEGETATION; VALLEY; EVENTS; RECORD; BASIN; ALPS	Extreme precipitation events may cause flooding in the subsurface as well as surficial drainage networks, and these flood events may be preserved in the speleothem archive. We describe here a study of stalagmites from the Cueva Rosa, a system with a perennial cave stream in a lower active level and abundant speleothems in a fossil gallery 6-8 m above the active level. Several constrictions in the lower level act as bottlenecks at discharges of 8-11 m(3)/s during high discharge events, flooding both lower and upper galleries. Because the cave stream is the only efflux for the small surface watershed (1 km(2)), it is possible to estimate the critical rainfall intensity rates and runoff required to flood the upper gallery. In the upper gallery, historical flooding is constrained by C-14 dates of wood fragments which register both a both post-bomb event and event at 420 yr BP. The latter event appears to coincide with deposition of thick mud deposit postdated by speleothem growth since 324 yr BP. A mid-Holocene (8.1-5.3 ka BP) speleothem from the upper gallery contains 26 detrital layers composed of clays and quartz grains evident in sectioned stalagmites and in Al content in LA-ICPMS analyses. The 9 most pronounced layers reach a thickness of 0.1-03 mm in the central growth axis. Petrography confirms that calcite crystal growth is continuous through these detrital layers and that they represent decantation events rather than hiatus in calcite deposition. In the mid-Holocene, large events have average recurrence of around 300 years, although large events are absent from the period from 7.3 to 6.3 ka and more frequent in the older and younger portions of the stalagmite. In the last four centuries, two major events have partially buried an actively growing stalagmite, showing that extreme precipitation events capable of flooding the upper gallery remain a persistent feature of the climate.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the riverine carbon, stable carbon isotopic composition and POC/PN (particulate nitrogen) ratio for different seasons, including an extreme flood event, in the lower Xijiang and its three tributaries. Stable carbon isotopic analyses are also performed for soil samples across the study region. Downstream decreases in delta C-13(POC) and POC/PN have been observed for all the tributaries. Meanwhile, the data obtained manifest a prominent positive shift of delta C-13(DIC) and negative shifts of both delta C-13(POC) and POC/PN from summer to winter. These observations suggest that the isotopic compositions of both DIC and POC are significantly affected by in-river primary production that converts DIC into organic matter through photosynthesis. It is estimated that the contribution of the riverine aquatic primary production to the riverine POC in the Xijiang and three tributaries of Guijiang, Hejiang and Luoding is respectively 7.1%, 43.2%, 36.4% and 9.9% in rainy season, and 35.6%, 47.3%, 50.3% and 40.1% in dry season. Based on the stoichiometry involved in chemical weathering of the bedrocks, the transformation of the carbonate-sourced DIC to POC is 3.4-20.5% in rainy season, and 12.3-22.1% in dry season. The transformation of DIC into POC implies an important sink of atmospheric CO2 in river systems and suggests a new mechanism for the old carbon effect in C-14 age of aquatic-environmental sediments.

Chronostratigraphic data (including foraminifera-based eco-biostratigraphy and delta O-18 records, tephrochronological markers and C-14 AMS radiometric datings) was derived from the shallow-shelf drill sites GeoB14403 (54.6 m recovery) and GeoB14414 (27.5 m), collected with both gravity and drilled MeBo cores in 193 m and 146 m water depth, respectively. The recovered intervals record Marine Isotope Stages and Substages (MIS) from MIS 5 to MIS 1, thus comprising major stratigraphic parts of the progradational deposits that form the last 100-ka depositional sequence. Calibration of shelf sedimentary units with borehole stratigraphies indicates the impact of higher-frequency (20-ka) sea level cycles punctuating this 100-ka cycle. This becomes most evident in the alternation of thick interstadial highstand (HST) wedges and thinner glacial forced-regression (FSST) units mirroring seaward shifts in coastal progradation. Albeit their relatively short-lived depositional phase, these subordinate HST units form the bulk of the 100-ka depositional sequence. Two mechanisms are proposed that likely account for enhanced sediment accumulation ratios (SAR) of up to 200 cm/ka during these intervals: (1) intensified activity of deep and intermediate Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) associated to the drowning of Mediterranean shelves, and (2) amplified sediment flux along the flooded shelf in response to hyperpycnal plumes that generate through extreme precipitation events during overall arid conditions. Equally, the latter mechanism is thought to be at the origin of undulated features resolved in the acoustic records of MIS 5 Interstadials, which bear a striking resemblance to modern equivalents forming on late-Holocene prodeltas of other Mediterranean shallow-shelf settings.

The abrupt change and the period in the extreme wet events data sets are characterized using a comprehensive time series analysis conducted with a moving t-test and Morlet wavelet. The results indicate that the regionally averaged frequency of extreme wet events has slightly increased by 0.001 times/y over the study period. The frequency of extreme wet events tended to decrease in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 2000s, whereas in the 1990s, the frequency of extreme wet events (0.47 times/y) exhibited an increasing trend that is significantly larger than the average level in the study area. During the summer monsoon period, extreme wet events exhibit a slight decreasing trend with fluctuations. Nevertheless, the extreme wet events demonstrate an increasing trend at the rate of 0.007 times/y during the winter monsoon period, especially in Sichuan province. The spatial distribution of extreme wet events exhibits a rough uniformity. Overall, the frequency of extreme wet events decreases from west to east, except for several discrepancies in southwestern Yunnan province and southeastern Guangxi province during certain periods. The increasing number of regions that experience extreme wet events is likewise primarily distributed in the higher altitude areas. The abrupt changes obtained in 2002 and 1988 occur during the summer monsoon and winter monsoon period, respectively. The annual frequency variation is a superposition of abrupt changes during the summer monsoon and winter monsoon periods. The major cycle of extreme wet events in these two periods changes according to 26 y and 12 y over the study period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

RADIOCARBON DATING HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIAL ON RAPA NUI: EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTY IN MARINE-DERIVED CARBON	RADIOCARBON			English	Article							STABLE-ISOTOPES; HUMAN DIET; COLLAGEN EXTRACTION; LATE COLONIZATION; ISLAND; NITROGEN; RATIOS; CALIBRATION; SETTLEMENT; ECOLOGY	A primary concern with dating skeletal material from oceanic environments is the effect of marine-derived carbon on resulting radiocarbon ages. Due to uncertainties in local marine reservoir effects and the proportion of marine carbon incorporated in bone, dates from archaeological skeletal material exhibiting marine dietary signatures have previously been characterized as problematic and removed from further analysis. While in certain instances this may be appropriate, in others it is not. This article presents 26 new C-14 dates obtained from human teeth (dentin collagen) on Rapa Nui. The effect of the local marine reservoir on 14C ages is evaluated assuming a range of incorporated marine-derived carbon. The results indicate that the Rapa Nui 14C ages are not significantly different under varying realistic extreme ranges in estimates of the proportion of marine carbon consumed. The article argues that this is primarily due to the small local marine reservoir effect measured in Rapa Nui and relatively lower reliance on marine resources in the prehistoric and protohistoric population.

Documenting the outcomes of these interactions for recent glacial cycles is important given current and future scenarios of polar ice retreat. However, this is currently hampered by lack of accurate constraints on ice sheet development and demise. Marine sedimentary Pb isotope records have potential to investigate these aspects of ice sheet feedbacks at high temporal resolution because of the sensitivity of the Pb isotope composition to continental weathering intensity and solute flux. Here we present a Pb isotope record sourced from the FeMn oxyhydroxide fraction in marine sediments from ODP Site 980 on Feni Drift (2168 mbsl, Rockall Trough, NE Atlantic), spanning the last 43 ka. The location of Site 980 at the northern edge of the British Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) makes it well-placed to monitor changes in BIIS development as it responded to migration of the Polar Front during the Last Glacial/Interglacial cycle. The data reveal millennial-scale cyclicity in Pb isotope composition, reminiscent of Dansgaard Oeschger cycles, from the start of the record until Heinrich event 2 (43-24 ka), characterised by extreme shifts to radiogenic compositions (i.e. variation in Pb-206/Pb-204 from similar to 18.9 to 20.5). The period 24-17.5 ka is also characterised by exceptionally radiogenic and highly variable Pb isotope compositions, associated with the rapid and repeated expansion and collapse of the BIIS.

We present here a detailed study of the sedimentary archive within a landslide-controlled impounded floodplain (Smrduta site, Czech Flysch Carpathians) using geochronological (C-14 and Cs-137), sedimentological and pollen evidence. A sedimentary sequence deposited above the landslide dam points to three highly discontinuous and instantaneous depositional events dated to 4.6 and 2.0 cal. ka BP, whereas the last cycle started approximately in the 17-18th centuries and has continued to recent times. Such sedimentary pulses characterized by the duration of several decades to a few centuries originated as a consequence of the blockage and/or reduction of the valley floor width by successive long-runout landslides from a slope formed by tectonically and lithologically anisotropic flysch bedrock. Stages of mass movement activity revealed by the Smrduta landslide correlate well with major humid late-Holocene oscillations suggesting its high sensitivity to century-scale climatic deteriorations. The character of lithological units forming individual sedimentary pulses, erosional hiatuses and sedimentary traces caused by the July 1997 extreme flood indicate a decisive role of large flood events during accretion and erosion of the floodplain-impounded section.

Distinctive Places, Suitable Spaces: Conceptualizing Mobile Group Occupational Duration and Landscape Use	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Occupational duration; Landscape; Site structure; Anticipated mobility; Site use; Mobility	NORTHWESTERN NEW-SPAIN; ACCUMULATIONS RESEARCH; DELICATE DIPLOMACY; ECONOMIC-RELATIONS; RESTLESS FRONTIER; GRAN-APACHERIA; SOUTHWEST; RANCHERIA; SITE	While extreme mobility and ensconced sedentism can be easily distinguished in the archeological record, effective means are lacking of discriminating between degrees of mobility that may range from seasonal shifts by farmers to recurrent moves across the landscape as a way of life. Fortunately, site layout and the way space is used are related to expectations regarding length of stay, and though they are not quantifiable measures, they provide linkages between the active and material realms. Short stays elicit a search for distinctive characteristics of a place rather than investing in the modification of a place. The quest for suitable spaces is a matter of fact among mobile groups, whereas sedentary groups, or those expecting to stay in one place for an extended period, tend to build their environment to suit their needs, even formalizing spaces in consistent ways from place to place. By understanding the ramifications of these concepts it is possible to distinguish between differing degrees of mobility of groups occupying similar environmental zones in the southern portion of the American Southwest in the protohistoric and early historic periods and to apply these to wider contexts.

Consequently, AMS radiocarbon dating of humic acids was used to assess age-depth in the cores. The reliability of the radiocarbon results near some of the core tops was evaluated through Pb-210 dating. The offset of sediment radiocarbon ages with their most probable time of formation and deposition in the lakes was found to be in the order of about 1000 years for recently deposited sediments. However, the basal dates in one core covering the entire postglacial period yielded a remarkable fit with previously established dates performed on marine shells at the maximum marine limit. Hence, the aim of this study was to describe how the two dating methods can be combined to address some of the problems paleolimnologists face when trying to assign ages to high-latitude lake sediment records. Suggestions are made for improving the quality of age-depth models developed in future studies for northernmost Quebec and other comparable regions where paleolimnologists must deal with the combined challenges of very slow sediment accumulation rates in lakes, an extreme paucity of datable material and the sequestration of old carbon in the watersheds.

Direct comparison of the carbon isotope composition of the annual rings from two specimens from the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, with the historic climatic record that exists from AD 1927 shows a response to the amount of rainfall recorded for each year. The delta C-13 response is particularly sensitive to extreme events such as tropical cyclones and droughts. It is demonstrated that whole wood samples provide an accurate record of climatic conditions. Although the result allows long-term periodicity in rainfall to be determined over the 134 years during which the oldest tree grew, the last 20 years is overprinted with a delta C-13 shift of anthropogenic origin. Signal processing approaches allow the interannual rainfall response to be separated from the long-term anthropogenic influences.

Extreme warm (1953-1962) and cold (1965-1974) decades in the modern record were used as modern analogues of climatic conditions during the early twentieth century and the LIA, respectively. Because of the minimal influence of precipitation during both extreme decades, temperature is the variable upon which the fluctuation of the ELA is dependent. Hence, the ELA Delta h pattern describes the spatial pattern of change in SAT across the QEI between the LIA and 1960. This pattern is consistent with the primary mode of variability of mean summer surface air temperature (SAT) in the modern record (ie, EOF-1, 1949-2002), the positive (negative) phase of which is strongly in place during the extreme warm (cold) decade. SAT anomalies in the QEI during the warm (cold) decade are positively correlated with a weak (strong) QEI-distal (QEI-proximal) polar vortex, higher (lower) than normal SSTs in the North Atlantic, and one of the lowest (highest) periods of sea-ice extent during the twentieth century. The climatic conditions during the cold decade are believed to describe conditions, which if sustained, would lead to a LIA-type cold episode capable of long-term snowline lowering and perennial snow/ice expansion. The climatic conditions during the warm decade represent possible modern analogues for those that might have occurred during the early twentieth century in the Canadian High Arctic, which led to a substantial reduction in perennial snow/ice.

Radiocarbon dating is problematic for dambos due to (i) oxidation of organic materials during dry seasons; and (ii) the potential for contemporary biological contamination of near-surface sediments. However, for luminescence dating the equatorial site and semi-arid climate facilitate grain bleaching, while the gentle terrain ensures shallow water columns, low turbidity, and relatively long surface exposures for transported grains prior to deposition and burial. For this study, we focused on dating sandy strata (indicative of high-energy fluvial events) at various positions and depths within a second-order dambo in central Uganda. Bluelight quartz optically stimulated luminescences (OSL) ages were compared with infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and thermoluminescence (TL) ages from finer grains in the same sample. A total of 8 samples were dated, with 6 intervals obtained at similar to 35, 33, 16, 10.4, 8.4, and 5.9 ka. In general, luminescence ages were stratigraphically, geomorphically and ordinally consistent and most bluelight OSL ages could be correlated with well-dated climatic events registered either in Greenland ice cores or Lake Victoria sediments. Based upon OSL age correlations, we theorize that extreme fluvial dambo events occur primarily during relatively wet periods, often preceding humid-to-arid transitions. The optical ages reported in this study provide the first detailed chronology of dambo sedimentation, and we anticipate that further dambo work could provide a wealth of information on the paleohydrology of Central and Southern Africa.

These earliest Neolithic settlements are all concentrated in a region that Pavle Cikovac calls the Sub-Mediterranean-Aegean (SMA) biogeographic region. It covers the northern and north-western edge of the Aegean, including Thessaly, Greek Macedonia and Greek Thrace, and extends further into the Balkans, but only along the valleys of the Vardar (Axios), Struma (Strymon) and Mesta (Nestos) rivers. Surprisingly, although Thrace is the closest landscape to Anatolia, it does not contain any sites of the earliest phase of the Neolithic at all beyond the narrow zone of the northern Marmara. In the present paper we explain this remarkable situation in terms of the natural environment in this particular region of the Southern Balkans. To begin, we propose that the lack of oldest Early Neolithic settlements in Thrace is related to the extreme microclimate of this region. As shown by modern vegetation analogues, Thracian oriental hornbeam-downy oak forests are exposed to stronger continental influence with frosts in the winter and average temperatures during the coldest months that are ca. 2-3 degrees C lower than those in the Central Balkans that have Sub-Mediterranean vegetation. In general terms, what we may expect is that the earliest Neolithic groups would first appear in regions with similarly mild conditions, on a yearly average, to those in the Mediterranean. Such mild conditions are indeed present in the SMA biogeographic region. On the other hand, before moving further to the north along the north-south oriented river systems of the Central Balkans, the Neolithic economy based on agriculture and stockbreeding would first have to be adapted to the relatively harsh winters in the Balkans. In consequence, it would have been possible to apply the new Neolithic lifestyle in the neighbouring areas of Thrace, Walachia, Dobrudzha and the Carpathian Basin only after a certain period of adaptation. Available C-14-data show that the adaptation period is identical to the time-span of Rapid Climate Change (RCC: 6550-6050 calBC) as defined in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Pre-Neolithic evidence for dog-assisted hunting strategies in Arabia	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Dog; Hunting; Hunting strategy; Domestication; Prey; Early Holocene; Environment; Neolithic	WOLF CANIS-LUPUS; SAUDI-ARABIA; DOMESTIC DOGS; INITIAL DOMESTICATION; GREY WOLF; NEAR-EAST; ROCK ART; ORIGIN; EVOLUTION; GOATS	The function of prehistoric dogs in hunting is not readily visible in the archaeological record; interpretations are thus heavily reliant on ethnographic data and remain controversial. Here we document the earliest evidence for dogs on the Arabian Peninsula from rock art at the sites of Shuwaymis and Jubbah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia. Hunting scenes depicted in the rock art illustrate dog-assisted hunting strategies from the 7th and possibly the 8th millennium BC, predating the spread of pastoralism. Though the depicted dogs are reminiscent of the modern Canaan dog, it remains unclear if they were brought to the Arabian Peninsula from the Levant or represent an independent domestication of dogs from Arabian wolves. A substantial dataset of 147 hunting scenes shows dogs partaking in a range of hunting strategies based on the environment and topography of each site, perhaps minimizing subsistence risk via hunting intensification in areas with extreme seasonal fluctuations. Particularly notable is the inclusion of leashes on some dogs, the earliest known evidence in prehistory. The leashing of dogs not only shows a high level of control over hunting dogs before the onset of the Neolithic, but also that some dogs performed different hunting tasks than others.

Dust clouds, climate change and coins: consiliences of palaeoclimate and economy in the Late Antique southern Levant	LEVANT			English	Article						palaeoclimate change; 536 AD dust veil; missing century; climate history; Byzantine Levant	EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN REGION; VOLCANIC DRY FOGS; NEAR-EAST; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; PLAGUE PANDEMICS; ROMAN-EMPIRE; TREE-RINGS; SOREQ CAVE; VARIABILITY; BYZANTINE	The climate factor has become a focus of much historical and archaeological investigation, encouraged recently by improvements in palaeoclimatic techniques and interest in global climate change. This article examines correlations between climate and history in the Byzantine southern Levant (c. 4th-7th centuries AD). A proposed 5th century economic downturn attested to by numismatic trends is shown to coincide with palaeoclimatic evidence for drought. We suggest a climatic ultimate cause for the apparent economic decline. In addition, the relationship between the Dust Veil Index (DVI) and annual precipitation in Jerusalem suggests the likelihood of increased precipitation following the 536 AD volcanic dust veil. This prediction is borne out by high-resolution precipitation reconstructions from Soreq Cave speleothems and by sedimentation records of extreme flash flooding. These finds complement palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Europe showing a drop in precipitation after 536 AD. Drought in Europe and flooding in the Middle East are both expected outcomes of global cooling during volcanic winters, such as those described in historical accounts of the 530s AD.

Middle Pleistocene subsistence in the Azraq Oasis, Jordan: Protein residue and other proxies	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Middle Pleistocene; Cross-over immunoelectrophoresis; Residue analysis; Jordan; Azraq; Shishan marsh; Lithics	PRESERVED BIOLOGICAL REMAINS; BLOOD RESIDUES; STONE TOOLS; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; SETTLEMENT DYNAMICS; 8-YEAR-OLD SAMPLE; PALEOLITHIC SITE; STABILITY; RECOVERY; SURVIVAL	Excavations at Shishan Marsh, a former desert oasis in Azraq, northeast Jordan, reveal a unique ecosystem and provide direct family-specific protein residue evidence of hominin adaptations in an increasingly arid environment approximately 250,000 years ago. Based on lithic, faunal, paleoenvironmental and protein residue data, we conclude that Late Pleistocene hominins were able to subsist in extreme arid environments through a reliance on surprisingly human-like adaptations including a broadened subsistence base, modified tool kit and strategies for predator avoidance and carcass protection.

The floods happened frequently in the Yihe-Shuhe River Basin in history, forming the alluvial plain and affecting the evolution of the ancient civilization. However, the complex sediment sources and depositional processes make the flood deposits difficult to be dated and consequently hinder our understanding to the palaeofloods. In this study, we present twelve Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) ages and four AMS C-14 ages of flood deposits to study the palaeoflood activities in the Yihe River Basin and its palaeoclimatic and archaeological implications. The youngest OSL age of 0.19 +/- 0.02 ka at the depth of 0.5 m shows that the residual OSL age, if any, must be much smaller than this amount, and the well comparison between OSL ages and AMS C-14 ages further confirm that the flood deposits could be well bleached before buried and consequently the OSL ages are not overestimated. The source of sediments from ground surface in the mountain regions in the upper stream and the special characteristic of quartz might have contributed to the sufficiently bleaching. Consequently, OSL dating has the potential to offer reliable chronology for the flood deposits. The extraordinary floods happened at 4.1-3.8 ka, 3.3-3.0 ka and 0.9-0.1 lea correspond to the global abrupt climatic events, demonstrating that the extreme floods might be caused by or be parts of these climatic instabilities in monsoonal China. The flood happened at 4.1-3.8 ka might have directly caused the decline of the highly developed late Neolithic civilization (Longshan Culture) in the Yihe-Shuhe River Basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Pelagic-benthic coupling within an upwelling system of the subtropical northeast Atlantic over the last 35 ka BP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Pelagic-benthic; Upwelling; Palaeoproductivity; Benthic foraminifera; Subtropical NE Atlantic	NORTHWEST AFRICA; NW-AFRICA; DEEP-SEA; CAPE BLANC; FORAMINIFERAL FAUNAS; PRODUCTIVITY CHANGES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CONTINENTAL-MARGIN; WATER CIRCULATION; OCEAN	We present a high resolution, multiproxy study of the relationship between pelagic and benthic environments of a coastal upwelling system in the subtropical NE Atlantic Ocean. Marine sediments corresponding to late MIS3 to the Holocene in the radiocarbon dated core GeoB7926, retrieved off Mauritania (21 degrees N) were analysed to reconstruct productivity in surface waters and its linkage to deep waters during the last 35 ka BP. High latitude cold events and changes in atmospheric and oceanographic dynamics influenced upwelling intensity over this time period. Subsequently, this caused changes in primary productivity off this low-latitude coastal upwelling locality. The benthic foraminiferal fauna displays four main community shifts corresponding to fundamental climatic events, first of all during late MIS3 (35 28 ka BP), secondly from 28 to 19 ka BP (including Heinrich event 2 and the LGM), thirdly within Heinrich event 1, the Bolling Allerod and the Younger Diyas (18-11.5 ka BP) and finally during the Holocene (11.5-0 ka BP). In particular, strong pelagic benthic coupling is apparent in MIS 3, as demonstrated by increased primary productivity, indicated by moderate DAR and the dominance of benthic foraminiferal species which prefer fresh phytodetritus. A decline in upwelling intensity and nutrient availability follows, which resulted in a proportionately larger amount of older, degraded matter, provoking a shift in the benthic foraminifera fauna composition. This rapid response of the benthic environment continues with a progressive increase in upwelling intensity due to sea level and oceanographic changes and according high surface production during the LGM. During Heinrich event 1 and the Younger Dryas, extreme levels of primary production actually hindered benthic environment through the development of low oxygen conditions. After this period, a final change in benthic foraminiferal community composition occurs which indicates a return to more oxygenated conditions during the Holocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rejolladas are collapse sinkholes with bases above the local water table. We present a spatial and physical analysis of 186 rejolladas in a 10 x 10 km area centered on Xuenkal. Basal diameters range from approximate to 22 to 264 m, areas range from 0.04 to 5.48 ha, and depths range from 4 to 12 m. Spatial density ranges from 0 to 8 rejolladas/km(2) with higher densities coinciding with known Ancient Maya settlements. Within Xuenkal, residential groups tend to be organized around and focused on the rejolladas. Some rejolladas have modified slopes that may be remnants of terraces or entry paths. High-resolution satellite imagery analysis demonstrates that rejolladas have denser and healthier vegetation than the surrounding landscape especially in the dry season. Microclimate data demonstrate that the bottom of rejolladas has less extreme diurnal temperature ranges, lower daytime highs, higher atmospheric moisture, and significantly higher and more stable soil moisture. Based on the archaeology at Xuenkal, it appears that the Ancient Maya recognized and actively exploited these environmental microniches for intensive cultivation both locally and regionally.

The results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between environment and human activities in the late Neolithic Jianghan Plain, discussed in the context of archaeological record and published available data. During the early Shijiahe culture (4.6-4.4 ka BP), a mixed broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forest, mainly consisting of evergreen Quercus, Pinus, Cyclobalanopsis, Liquidambar, and Ulmus, developed at Tanjialing. The high values of TOC, TN, and C/N suggests that the organic matter is mainly from allochthonous terrestrial plants. Combined with delta C-13(org) analysis, C-3 plants occupied the area, and the climate was warm and humid, with less human disturbance during this period. The abrupt rise of TOC, TN and C/N content and decrease of delta C-13(org), combined with the local spread of Typha and Cyperaceae, show that this area witnessed a short-term water regime expansion event during the early period of the Shijiahe culture. In the mid-period of the Shijiahe culture (4.4-42 ka BP), a significant rise in herbs especially Poaceae and a remarkable decline in broadleaved trees imply an increasingly intensified human interference. The continuous decline of TOC, TN and C/N content indicates the reduction of allochthonous organic matter from terrestrial plants. All proxies' responses suggest decreasing effective moisture and temperature during this stage. In the early and middle period of the Shijiahe culture, the warm and wet climate was favorable for agriculture, which promoted the prosperity of the Shijiahe culture, and Shijiahe ancient city played an important role in the defense against flood and invasion. Chronic drought around 4.2 ka BP not only hindered the development of local agriculture, but also hindered the ditch system work, leading to the fall of the Shijiahe culture. The defense function of the ancient city vanished due to dry climate and groundwater decline: therefore, the ancient city was abandoned. The extreme events (flood, extreme drought etc.) related to the climate transformation played an important role in the legendary Yu Zheng Sanmiao War. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Bayesian age modelling applied to palaeoflood geochronologies and the investigation of Holocene flood magnitude and frequency	HOLOCENE			English	Article						Bayesian age modelling; flood magnitude and frequency; palaeofloods; radiocarbon dating; Spain	SOUTHWESTERN UNITED-STATES; FLUVIAL DEPOSITS; HISTORICAL FLOODS; EXTREME FLOODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CENTRAL SPAIN; TAGUS RIVER; NE SPAIN; RECORD; HYDROLOGY	A new methodology, based on Bayesian age modelling, is presented for the analysis of palaeoflood geochronologies and palaeodischarge data. Bayesian age models were developed, using the Oxcal radiocarbon calibration software, for the geochronologies of three palaeoflood sites in Spain, namely the Gaudalentin, Tagus and Llobregat rivers in SE, Central and NE Spain, respectively. The age-depth plots resulting from the applied Sequence models enabled the construction of flood magnitude-frequency plots through substitution of the original stratigraphic depth data with the associated minimum discharge quantified by hydraulic modelling. The age models presented demonstrate that a Bayesian approach for analyzing Holocene flood magnitude and frequency prevents the loss of geomorphic and hydrologic information inherent in radiocarbon frequency methods previously used in the analysis of palaeoflood data sets. Frequency approaches do not allow proper consideration of flood magnitude information and only incorporate those geomorphic units specifically dated. The Bayesian age models calculate modeled ages for undated units as well, so that all the individual flood events identified in the field can be incorporated and visualized in the data output. The palaeoflood age models therefore illustrate: (1) the age range for clusters of palaeoflood events; (2) the number of events within each flood cluster, with an age estimate and palaeodischarge value for each event; and (3) the potential impact of discharge censoring on the record, for example the role of accommodation space infilling on the quantification of palaeodischarge. The methodology and results are briefly discussed within the wider context of fluvial palaeohydrology, in particular: (1) the role of Bayesian modelling in future fluvial palaeohydrology research; and (2) the value of bedrock gorge sites for investigating past flood-climate relationships, given the problems of deciphering allogenic and autogenic drivers in alluvial sedimentary records.

Environment-human relationships in historical times: The balance between urban development and natural forces at Leptis Magna (Libya)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							RIVER; CALIBRATION; EARTHQUAKE; STREAM	The relationships between human modification of the environment and natural events in the Roman city of Leptis Magna (UNESCO world heritage), western Libya, are analyzed. For the first time, the history of Leptis Magna is tested against a geomorphological and stratigraphical reconstruction and radiocarbon dating. Historical and archaeological interpretations or analyses indicate the occurrence of different extreme natural events as the cause of the town's decline: earthquakes, flooding, and tsunami. Geological and geomorphological surveys investigated the dynamics of the nearby Wadi Lebda, a major dryland stream that forms the depositional and erosional systems of the settlement area. Alluvial phases were studied by applying traditional stratigraphic analyses of outcrops and hand-cores. Additionally, the mapped flights of inset terrace surfaces provided insights into the human modifications of the natural depositional/erosional environment during historical times and the following alluvial phases affecting the Leptis Magna harbor. The results integrate the archaeological knowledge by providing some independent chronological constraints, and indicate that Leptis Magna history was tightly linked to the Wadi Lebda. Aware of the hazards related to devastating flooding, the Romans were able to cope with the threat posed by the wadi by performing engineering defensive hydraulic works around the town (dam and artificial channels). Once the economic decay began and the society could no longer guarantee the ongoing maintenance of these structures, the decline of the settlement started and the occurrence of destructive floods reclaimed the populated areas. Conversely, the occurrence of a large earthquake (365 CE), or of a tsunami that caused the disruption of the hydraulic systems and the infill of the harbor, has been discarded as primary cause of the decline of Leptis Magna.

Although information about these parameters exists for the last glacial period, little detailed information exists for older time periods. New information from ODP Site 1085 for Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 12-10 shows that glacial interglacial productivity trends linked to upwelling variability followed a pattern similar to the last glacial cycle, with maximums shortly before glacial maxima, and minimums shortly before glacial terminations. During the MIS-11/10 transition, several periodic oscillations in productivity and monsoonal proxies are best explained by southwards shifts in the southern sub-tropical high-pressure cells followed by abrupt northwards shifts. Comparison to coeval sea-surface temperature measurements suggests that these monsoonal cycles were tightly coupled to anti-phased hemispheric climate change, with an intensified summer monsoon during periods of Northern (Southern) Hemisphere cooling (warming). The timing of these events suggests a pacing by insolation over precession periods. A lack of similar regional circulation shifts during the MIS-13/12 transition is likely due to the large equatorwards shift in the tropical convection zone that occurred during this extreme glaciation.

Holocene sulphur-rich palaeochannel sediments: diagenetic conditions, magnetic properties and archaeological implications	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Palaeochannels; Iron sulphides; Diagenesis; Framboids; Palaeomagnetic dating	GREIGITE FE3S4; PYRITE FORMATION; MAGNETOTACTIC BACTERIA; BIOGENIC MAGNETITE; REMANENCE; SOIL; BIOMINERALIZATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; EVOLUTION; WETLANDS	Extensive aggregate extraction in the middle Trent valley, England, has revealed a sequence of Holocene palaeochannels associated with nationally important, and predominantly organic, archaeological remains. This paper reports observations of hyper-acidity (below pH 2), high natural magnetism and metallic sphaerules (framboids) in Holocene palaeochannel sediments at two sites in the middle Trent valley. These properties are associated with high natural remanent magnetism which has allowed the successful palaeomagnetic dating of palaeochannel fills at one of these sites (Hemington). These sediment properties are the result of the formation of ferromagnetic iron sulphides, including griegite, under conditions of high sulphur availability (from groundwater) in the presence of metallic ions and organic matter under low redox conditions, with later oxidation producing the extreme natural acidity through oxidation of disulphide (pyrite). These findings explain why, under certain groundwater conditions, alluvial palaeochannel sediments can carry post-depositional remanent magnetisation and be suitable for palaeomagnetic dating. The low pH may also be beneficial in the initial stage of wood preservation and if the sediments remain waterlogged, but probably not retard decomposition after drainage and acidification, a process that is increasingly being recognised as a threat to archaeological sites in wetland environments.

Based on these data, we are able to reconstruct shifts of the desert margin in two period extremes, the last glacial maximum (21-15 ka) and the Holocene Optimum (9-5 ka). We have compared the present desert margin with that for the two extremes. The results indicate that a southward shift of the present margin of about 3 degrees in latitude might be caused by anthropogenic impact. Hence the influence of human activity must be taken into consideration for sustainable development and environment protection. Future research will be to find a two-way feedback existing between climate and anthropogenic impacts.

The diatoms exhibited six marked changes in Diatom Zones (DZ) with included water/sediment interface, as the record of environmental changes detected by marine and other terrestrial palaeoclimate records. The diatoms recorded at the deepest sediments were interpreted to represent Pleistocene/Holocene transition. The dated Holocene history is top 810 cm core section, ca. 8.1 cal kyr BP to the present. The first zone record (1101-1050 cm) was interpreted as alkaline, oligo-mesotrophic, oxic lentic ecosystem of the karstic flooding plain based on the dominance of Epithemia adnata. Enhanced bioproductivity of the shallow and unstable environment was noticed in the second diatom zone (1050-815 cm), which was interpreted as the beginning of the Holocene and it was divided into 4 subzones because of rapid environmental fluctuations. A warmer period of temperate climate with a pluvial phase initiated development of the oligo-beta mesosaprobic shallow lake in the early Holocene. The expansion of the macrophytes and higher cyanobacteria production that caused acidification and oxygen depletion at the lake bottom was determined in the mid-Holocene (810-713 cm; 8.1-7.1 cal kyr BP). Mid-Holocene (8.1-4.7 cal kyr BP) is marked by oligohalobic freshwater Epithemia argus characteristic for alkaline water. High cyanobacteria production was determined as a consequence of algal production that induced anoxic conditions in the lake bottom sediments from the warmer period till today. The initial marine influx through the permeable karst underground was observed in the sediment record from ca. 5 cal kyr BP. The discovered marine influence on the lake indicating brackish water conditions related to the Holocene sea-level high stand. The sea intrusion had different intensities through time and is still observed today in the seasonal fluctuation of lake water salinity. The Late Holocene (2.7 cal kyr BP to the present) sediment record is characterized with the strongest marine influxes and highest biodiversity of the beta mesosaprobic lake. Major changes in the water/sediment interface of very shallow karstic lake were caused by anthropogenic agricultural activity in Vrana. Diatom compositions of Lake Vrana indicate that they are sensitive to both paleoclimatic changes, freshwater influx and sea level rise (marine intrusion through permeable karst).

Today, these harbours are totally or partly silted and concealed under modern urban infrastructure. Comprehensive geoarchaeological studies were conducted on the northeastern fringe of the Analipsis Peninsula where excavations have revealed the archaeological remains of a massive quay wall (Pierri and Arion sites). These remains are located east of known ancient harbour structures that belong to the Alkinoos Harbour. Our study aimed to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental setting of the harbour facilities at the Pierri site, including the analysis of the local sedimentary record in order to detect and differentiate natural and man-made triggers that caused environmental shifts. At the Pierri site, we found geoarchaeological evidence for an ancient harbour basin related to the prominent quay wall. Associated harbour sediments indicate a protected harbour which was developed from an open shallow marine environment, most probably by the construction of breakwaters. Harbour deposits were dated using radiocarbon analyses and diagnostic ceramic fragments to the 4th to 3rd cent. BC. This is in good agreement with the age of the harbour installations as such archaeologically assigned to the Classical and Hellenistic period. The Pierri site was possibly in function as a harbour facility even before the 4th cent. BC. In any case, it was strongly hit by an earthquake and associated tsunami event during Classical to Hellenistic times. By this event, the harbour was uplifted and covered by event deposits so that it was not usable any more. It was subsequently buried by anthropogenic and colluvial sediments. Overall, the Pierri coastal archive allowed to identify three distinct tsunami landfall events, namely before 2483-2400 cal BC (event I), after 2483-2400 cal BC and before 370-214 cal BC (event II), and during Classical to Hellenistic times, most probably between the 4th and 3rd cent. BC (event III). Another tsunami event (event IV) potentially hit the site when it was dry land. Ages of tsunami events I-II and candidate tsunami IV are consistent with tsunamis known from the coasts of western Greece and southern Italy and where thus classified as supra-regional tele-events. Event III was identified as associated to a local earthquake and tsunami by which Corfu Island was uplifted and, at the same time, tilted with a vertical offset of 1.74 m from W to E.

Based on geochemical analysis and organic matter content established using loss on ignition and reflectance spectroscopy, we identified six periods of increased glacial activity over the last 1700 yr. Each is in accordance with records from reference glaciers in the Alps. A total of 255 graded layers were identified and interpreted as flood deposits. Most of these occurred during glacial advances such as the Little Ice Age period and exhibit thicker deposits characterized by an increase in the fine grain-size fraction. Fine sediment produced by glacial activity is transported to the proglacial lake during heavy rainfall events. The excess of glacial flour during these periods seems to increase the watershed's tendency to produce flood deposits in the lake sediment, suggesting a strong influence of the glacier on flood reconstruction records. Thus, both flood frequency and intensity, which is estimated based on layer thickness as a proxy, cannot be used in reconstruction of past extreme events because of their variability. There is a need to take into account changes in sediment supply in proglacial areas that could preclude satisfactory interpretation of floods in terms of past climate variability.

These present rather varied features from one extreme (Alpine watershed) to the other (Emilian Apennines watershed). In the early Holocene, the plain area included between the two mountain chains - the Venetian-Po plain - was extended some tens km to the south with respect to the present day coast. This vast territory has been the object of research since the 1970s and 1980s. Field activities have allowed identifying a rich set of sites that occupy different topographic and geographic locations, thus composing an articulated mosaic characterised by a much wider variability with respect to the well-known case of the Adige basin, located at the western limit of the examined area, which is exclusively included within a mountain territory. In this paper, we analyse for the first time the rich record from this area in its whole with the aim of investigating the territorial organisation of hunteregatherer groups on a wide scale. This research has allowed us to set hypotheses on the mobility and occupation strategies of human groups and on the key-aspects that may have favoured the extensive and intensive occupation of this area. Besides the supposed presence of a biomass compatible with the demographic increase that has characterised this period, we also suggest that the "pragmatic" Sauveterrian technological systems played an important role in the adaptation of early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers to the varied ecosystems offered by this area.

Case study on the wetlands of the Great Hungarian Plain	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	CBW Conference	NOV, 2014	Cluj Napoca, ROMANIA			Medieval environmental change; Historical flood vulnerability; Settlement abandonment; Wetland history; Climate migration	AGE; RECONSTRUCTION; FLOODPLAIN; MOVEMENTS; SOCIETIES; EXTREMES; EUROPE; RECORD; RIVERS	The paper focuses on changes in settlement patterns on the frontier zones of wetlands and areas suitable for settling in the Great Hungarian Plain, Central Europe. Based on the statistical analysis of archaeological site elevations in a 4.128 km(2) lowland landscape, it is demonstrated that archaeological sites of the Arpad Period (AD 970-1300) were situated significantly (p = 0.01; n = 427) lower than those of the late medieval period (AD 1300-1540). Statistical results suggest that rising water levels are likely to have influenced the migration and transformation in settlement patterns from the Medieval Warm Epoch (mid-10th - mid-13th century) to the first part of the Little Ice Age (mid-13th century - mid-16th century). Zonal analysis also revealed close connections between flood-prone geomorphological features and spatiotemporal variations of settlement patterns during the medieval climate change. With regard to the lowland character of the extensive study area, its relatively high flood vulnerability and the numerous analogies from Europe and the Carpathian Basin, only one out of the multitude of factors influencing site selection, water level changes can be interpreted as a rational explanation for the vertical displacement of the settlement pattern.

Analysis shows the presence of distinctive features within the Acheulean assemblage besides the presence of handaxes. Hominins used flint and limestone on the site: a lithological analysis shows a predominance of the same raw materials in every unit and a partial selective exploitation. In unit B, traditionally associated with so-called "Mode 2", the knapper principally intended to produce a sharp or convergence of the sharps (choppers or bifacial tools). In the E/E1 units, flaking prevails on the sporadic shaping: the presence of cores with polyhedral forms and the extreme dimensional reduction of objects are other main technical features associated with this core and flake assemblage. The presence or absence of handaxes is not the only element of variability: the presence of micro-tools and other technical elements represent technological innovations in the Lower Pleistocene assemblages common to many Italian sites during the so-called "Mode 1-2" transition. The traditional idea of Acheulean as an uniform entity characterized by the presence of handaxes does not seem to be valid. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Samples accumulated through human activity at the sites, thus climatic interpretations are in direct chronological association with periods of human presence in the local landscape. Wild Ammotragus lervia (Barbary sheep) and Bos sp. (auroch), and domestic Ovis sp. and Capra sp. from the Levalloiso-Mousterian (>= 73.3-43.5 ka) to the Neolithic (similar to 9.3-5.4 ka) cultural phases are analysed. Results indicate that the most arid environment represented by the samples occurred at similar to 32 ka, when populations associated with Dabban lithic assemblages were present within the region. Climatic instability increased during oxygen isotope stage 2. Consistent with other palaeoenvironmental investigations in the Gebel Akhdar, there is no evidence for hyper-arid events during the last glacial and surface water, most probably in the form of local springs, was available throughout the time periods considered. Overall, results indicate that different cultural groups occupied the Gebel Akhdar landscape under different climatic conditions, but that climate variations appear to have been of lower magnitude than those that occurred at inland North African locations. These reconstructions provide further support to the theory that the Gebel Akhdar may have served as a refugium for human populations in North Africa during times of global climatic extremes.

These records and other proxy climate data indicate a loose teleconnection with the southern African climatic record, especially for regionwide episodes of dry conditions resulting from extreme El Nio events. However, archaeological evidence of hunter-gatherer and nomadic pastoralist occupation does not mirror the climate record by indicating that the desert was only inhabited during periods of favourable rainfall. It points instead to a specialized strategy which allowed continuous occupation of the Namib Desert despite extreme fluctuations in rainfall, by combining the use of primary resource areas with opportunistic use of secondary, ephemeral resources in an alternating density-dependent and density-independent dynamic.

Over longer timescales, climate change may alter fire regimes; thus, we used fire-related alluvial deposits to assess the timing of moderate- to high-severity fires, their geomorphic impact, and relation to climate over the last 4000 yr. Fire-related sedimentation does not clearly follow millennial-scale climatic changes, but probability peaks commonly correspond with severe drought, e.g., within the interval 1700-1400 cal yr BP, and ca. 650 and ca. 410 cal yr BP. The latter episodes were preceded by prolonged wet intervals that could promote dense stands. Estimated recurrence intervals for fire-related sedimentation are 250-400 yr. Climatic differences with aspect influenced Holocene post-fire response: fire-related deposits constitute 77% of fan sediments from north facing basins but only 39% of deposits from drier southerly aspects. With sparser vegetation and exposed bedrock, south aspects can generate runoff and sediment when unburned, whereas soil-mantled north aspects produce minor sediment unless severely burned. Recent channel incision appears unprecedented over the last 2300 yr, suggesting that fuel loading and extreme drought produced an anomalously severe burn in 2002. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

About half of the sedimentary sequence is composed of mass movement deposits (MMDs) and the event-corrected record reaches back to 51,200 cal BP. Here we present a high-resolution rock-magnetic study revealing two sedimentary fades associated with MMDs and characterized by two different types of spurious gyroremanent magnetization (GRM) acquired during static alternating field demagnetization. The first rock-magnetic signature is detected in MMDs composed of reworked sand and tephra material. The signature consists of GRM acquired during demagnetization of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and other rock-magnetic properties typical of iron sulfides such as greigite. We interpret these intervals as authigenic formation of iron sulfides in suboxic conditions within the MMD. The second rock-magnetic signature consists of a series of 10 short intervals located on the top of MMDs characterized by GRM acquisition during demagnetization of the isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). Based on geological, limnological, stratigraphic and climatic evidence these layers are interpreted as reflecting pedogenic hematite and/or goethite brought to the lake by runoff events related to precipitation and permafrost melt. The pedogenic iron minerals mobilized from the catchment most likely settled out of suspension on top of MMDs after a rapid remobilization event. The series of runoff events corresponds to periods of increased lacustrine productivity in Laguna Potrok Aike and are coeval within the limit of the chronology to warm periods of the Last Glacial as recorded in Antarctica, the deglaciation in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and enhanced precipitation during the Early Holocene in southeastern Patagonia.

Changes in large rainstorm magnitude-frequency over the last century in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo and their geomorphological implications	HOLOCENE			English	Article						Borneo; Danum Valley; extreme rainfall events; heavy rainfall; historical climatology; pipe erosion; Sabah; tropical climatic change; tropical geomorphology	RAIN-FOREST CATCHMENTS; EXTREME EVENTS; TROPICAL CYCLONES; SECULAR CHANGES; SEDIMENT LOADS; SOUTH-PACIFIC; DANUM-VALLEY; TEMPERATURE; EROSION; INTENSITY	Increases in the frequency of large to extreme rainfall events are widely predicted with global warming, but evidence from the humid tropics is hampered by a paucity of long-term data. This paper assesses changes in daily rainfall magnitude-frequency and their geomorphological consequences in the equatorial environment of northern Borneo using (1) rare daily rainfall data series for 1906-2012 assembled from archival and current sources and (2) geomorphological process data from the Danum Valley area of eastern Sabah. Rainstorm changes are explored using (1) analysis of frequencies of daily falls above threshold values, (2) extreme-value analysis comparing differences in locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) best-fit curves for successive 20-year periods and (3) a novel approach constructing graphs of long-term change in daily falls of 1- to 10-year return period derived from overlapping 20-year LOESS curves. Substantial increases, some statistically significant, since 1980 (intensifying since 1999) are detected at most stations in (1) the frequency of daily falls 50, 100 and 200 mm and (2) the magnitudes of daily falls with return periods of 0.2-5.0 years. The scale and temporal patterns of historical change vary with (1) coastal aspect and (2) different parts of the return period spectrum. The period 1921-1940 exhibited higher rainstorm magnitude-frequency than 1952-1979 and demonstrates the dangers of simple deductions derived from post-1960 data comparisons. Geomorphological responses indicated by long-term monitoring at Danum (eastern Sabah), where there has been a marked upswing in heavy rainfalls since 1999, include a threefold increase in slopewash rates, more frequent high flows and higher sediment loads. The very high soil pipe sediment yields, rates of pipe roof collapse and stream channel extension recorded from 2002 to 2012 in pipe systems at Danum may be a consequence of this upswing. Increased landsliding is also a likely consequence, exacerbated in logged, agricultural and urban terrain.	[Walsh, Rory P.

In some studies the monitoring was limited, for longer or shorter periods, to air Temperature and Relative Humidity logging, which can show if extreme values and rates of variation occur. In other cases mechanical monitoring was combined with microclimatic logging, which provides quantitative information directly related to the microclimate; these data are useful to validate mathematical models that eventually may predict the long-term behaviour of the objects. Although the quality of the information obtainable by combined mechanical-hygrothermal monitoring is more directly usable, due to the actual response to the microclimate, using simply logged microclimatic data it is possible to formulate a statistical analysis aimed at defining microclimate variance. Museums all over the world are engaged in lively discussions regarding the long-term conservation of works of art created using hygroscopic materials, which are sensitive to microclimate fluctuations. The climate fluctuations can have both temporary and permanent effects on the hygroscopic objects and they are a potential cause of damage. The current preventive approach is based on a compromise between the technical limitations of the museums' air conditioning plants and the presumed needs of the objects, as determined by conservators and conservation scientists. The primary goal is to keep the climate as stable as possible around standard values, with strict fluctuation ranges usually defined as 20 degrees C +/- 2 and 50% RH +/- 5. There is considerable pressure in favor of widening the allowable ranges, based on the need of a lighter carbon footprint as well as to facilitate the loan of artifacts between institutions. Although we have long-term evidence of the generally positive effects of a microclimate within the standard range of allowable fluctuations, we lack experimental data regarding the effects under broader ranges. Wooden works of art are useful in representing the complexity of possible reactions. Because of the mechanical response caused by thermo-hygrometric conditions, the monitoring of Wooden Objects of Art ( WOAs) in their exhibition and storage environment is important in order to protect them from potential physical/mechanical degradation. Due to the specificity of each artwork, both from its structural point of view and from its previous microclimatic history ( for the most part totally unknown), the analysis of an artifact's response to short-and long-term variations can supply useful information about its "individual" sensitivity to the exhibition microclimate, suggesting the adoption of more or less rigid parameters. Case studies monitoring wooden objects have been conducted for many years. In some studies, the monitoring was limited, for longer or shorter periods, to air T/RH logging, which can verify if extreme values and types of variation occur. In other cases, mechanical monitoring was combined with microclimatic logging, which provides quantitative information directly related to the microclimate; these data are useful to validate mathematical models that eventually may predict the long-term behavior of the objects. Although the quality of the information obtainable by combined mechanical-hygrothermal monitoring is of higher magnitude, using simply logged microclimatic data makes possible to formulate a statistical analysis aimed at defining microclimate variance, obtaining a very efficient schematization of the greater or lesser stability of the climate according to the presumed lower or higher sensitivity of the artifact under consideration. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how delicate the widening of allowable ranges is and how misleading a generalized approach can be, while the eventual choices of standards relaxation must be based on careful analysis of the long-term response of the objects.

Approximate tusk measurements and extreme wear on the sixth molars indicate it is best referred to an old male. Its geological age was controversial because the first two Holocene bone collagen radiocarbon dates were derived evidently from contaminated samples. Three new radiocarbon dates on carefully selected bone and ivory are close, averaging 12,190 BP, and indicate that this mammoth died before the close of the Wisconsinan glaciation and near the time of extinction of woolly mammoths in this part of North America. Its assignment to regional pollen subzone 1b suggests that, like the Rostock Mammoth of similar age from southern Ontario, it lived in a tundra woodland environment. The Highgate Mastodon (Mammut americanum) and giant beaver (Castoroides ohioensis) found 4 km away and also assigned to pollen subzone 1b suggests that some spruce wetlands characterised the tundra woodland environment, and that perhaps woolly mammoths and American mastodons lived almost side by side in southern Ontario about12,000 radiocarbon years or 14,000 calendar years ago. The Muirkirk Mammoth is discussed in relation to the dispersal history of woolly mammoths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.	[Harington, C.

This article examines the development of control in two Swedish museum buildings up until the 1930s: Nationalmuseum and Gripsholm Castle. Nationalmuseum was erected to make the state collections more accessible to the public and to provide monitoring and central heating. At that time knowledge of climatic conditions in museums was tacit and based on personal experience rather than on scientific studies. However; in the early twentieth century the problem of managing museum climate increased as curators became more aware of the dehydrating effects of heating on panels and polychrome wood. The first successful attempts to automatically control indoor climate were carried out at Gripsholm in the 1920s. The focus was then on monitoring and controlling temperature rather than relative humidity, but these early attempts also showed that extreme levels if humidity could be avoided in an environment that had never been designed for permanent heating. This article examines attempts at managing indoor climate between the 1860s and the 1930s.

Our research has allowed us to recognize climate changes and four extreme wave events in the Guadalquivir paleoestuary, which might have contributed to both the cultural change that is observed in the archaeological record at the end of the Chalcolithic and the subsequent population decline during much of the Bronze Age.

This study presents an analysis of daily precipitation records over the past half century (1960-2013) from 26 meteorological stations in northern China (Jing-Jin-Ji district) and attempts to identify spatial and temporal changes based on ten indices for extreme precipitation. Our analysis showed that all regionally averaged extreme precipitation indices were characterized by decreasing trends, of which the maximum one-day and five-day precipitation amounts (RX1day and RX5day) exhibited significant decreasing trends. We further considered possible triggering mechanisms for these trends, such as the recent continual weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon, although the detailed physical mechanisms need further study. Our analysis also showed that extreme precipitation patterns have varied spatially and exhibited a clear increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast except for consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD). A correlation analysis showed that all indices except CDD had significant positive correlations with annual total precipitation(ATP); all indices except CDD and CWD had negative correlations with station elevation. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the patterns of changes in precipitation extremes that provide essential information for water resource management, natural hazard prevention and mitigation, and reliable future climate and environmental projections for policy makers in the Jing-Jin-Ji district. The results indicated that a higher spatial and temporal resolution analysis of extreme precipitation is needed in the study area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

This paper reconstructs the dust transport to the region during the termination of glacial Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6; similar to 135-129 ka) and the last interglacial peak period (MIS5e, similar to 129-1161(a). We use chemical and Nd and Sr isotope compositions of fine detritus material recovered from sediment core drilled at the deepest floor of the Dead Sea. The data is integrated with data achieved from cores drilled at the floor of the Red Sea, thus, forming a Red Sea-Dead Sea transect extending from the desert belt to the Mediterranean climate zone. The Dead Sea accumulated flood sediments derived from three regional surface cover types: settled desert dust, mountain loess-soils and loess-soils filling valleys in the Dead Sea watershed termed here "Valley Loess". The Valley Loess shows a distinct Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of 0.7081 +/- 1, inherited from dissolved detrital calcites that originate from dried waterbodies in the Sahara and are transported with the dust to the entire transect. Our hydro-climate and synoptic conditions reconstruction illustrates the following history: During glacial period MIS6, Mediterranean cyclones governed the transport of Saharan dust and rains to the Dead Sea watershed, driving the development of both mountain soils and Valley Loess. Then, at Heinrich event 11, dry western winds blew Saharan dust over the entire Red Sea - Dead Sea transect marking latitudinal expansion of the desert belt. Later, when global sea-level rose, the Dead Sea watershed went through extreme aridity, the lake retreated, depositing salt and accumulating fine detritus of the Valley Loess. During peak interglacial MIS 5e, enhanced flooding activity flushed the mountain soils and fine detritus from all around the Dead Sea and Red Sea, marking a significant "contraction" of the desert belt. At the end of MIS 5e the effect of the regional precipitation diminished and the Dead Sea and Red Sea areas re-entered sever arid conditions with extensive salt deposition at the Dead Sea.

A case study analysis was focused in Rambla de la Viuda (drainage area of 1500 km(2)) whose stream flow is related to extreme rainfalls. A 500 years sedimentary archive was reconstructed from eight stratigraphic profiles comprising continuous sequences of slackwater flood deposits interbedded with episodic colluvial and edaphic horizons. Discharge estimates associated to sedimentary flood evidences were obtained from one-dimensional hydraulic modelling. The strati graphic units were sampled to characterise their geochemical and paleobotanical (phytoliths) contents. Palaeoflood chronology was obtained from radiocarbon and luminescence (OSL) dating, supported by documentary data (written historical documents). A high frequency and high magnitude palaeoflood period took place during the 15th-middle 16th century, which seem to correlate in time with general wetter conditions. Three short-term environment stability conditions (land use and climatic) also made possible the development of three paleosols. The lowest flood magnitude and discharges in the sedimentary record was found between the mid-17th to mid-18th centuries, under prevailing drier environmental conditions. Episodic high magnitude flooding took place at late 18th century, correlating in time with palaeovegetation and geochemical evidences of important changes on land use (deforestation and grazing). Poorer developed soils were found at upper stratigraphic sequences (19th century) characterised by thick units of colluvium deposits, usually culminating sequences of short-lived continuous slackwater flood units. Despite of the potential human influence (land-use) on soil hydrology, the long-term behaviour of high magnitude floods (>1000 m(3) s(-1)) has been stationary over the last 500 years.

Numerical approach to the study of coastal boulders: The case of Martigues, Marseille, France	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Sea storm; Boulders; Hydrodynamic equation	EASTERN RHONE DELTA; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SOUTHERN FRANCE; IONIAN COAST; TSUNAMI; WAVES; TRANSPORT; DEPOSITS; ACCUMULATIONS; PROVENCE	The coastal area extending east of the city of Martigues, between the bays of Bonnieu and that of Chariot, is characterized by an alternation of gently sloping rocky coast and 5 m high cliffs composed of Miocene limestone. The foot of the cliff is marked by a well developed notch and a discontinuous wave-cut platform; at its base, the sea bottom reaches a maximum depth of about 4.5-6 m. The emerged area shows boulders placed up to 10 m inland of the coastline at around 2 m above s.l. and, weighing as much as 35 tonnes. A geomorphological survey was conducted by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner to estimate boulder sizes. The particular focus of the proposed study was to estimate the minimum wave height required to detach and transport two boulders, originally joined together as one bigger one and weighing approximately 25 tonnes, from the wave-cut platform onto the surf bench. Hydrodynamic models developed by various authors were used to calculate the minimum wave height necessary to move them. The data obtained from the resulting hydrodynamic equations were compared to wave climate data collected over the last 15 years by the buoy off the coast of Marseille, in the Gulf of Lion. The present study seems to confirm that it would not have been necessary to have a tsunami impact (among other things, never recorded in the last 20 years) to move a 25 tonnes boulder. Indeed, hydrodynamic equations suggest that the boulder might have been broken and only subsequently moved due to the impact of waves generated by an extreme storm which would have occurred prior to December 2003. This hypothesis seems to be in agreement with the morphology of the sea bottom, hydrodynamic features of the area as well as eyewitnesses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Based on a new direct land-sea comparison in SW Iberian margin IODP Site U1385 we examine the climatic variability between 1100 and 1050 ka including the "super interglacial" MIS 31, a period dominated by the 41-ky obliquity periodicity. Pollen and biomarker analyses at centennial-scale resolution provide new insights into the regional vegetation, precipitation regime and atmospheric and oceanic temperature variability on orbital and suborbital timescales. Our study reveals that atmospheric and SST warmth during MIS 31 was not exceptional in this region highly sensitive to precession. Unexpectedly, this warm stage stands out as a prolonged interval of a temperate and humid climate regime with reduced seasonality, despite the high insolation (precession minima values) forcing. We find that the dominant forcing on the long-term temperate forest development was obliquity, which may have induced a decrease in summer dryness and associated reduction in seasonal precipitation contrast. Moreover, this study provides the first evidence for persistent atmospheric millennial-scale variability during this interval with multiple forest decline events reflecting repeated cooling and drying episodes in SW Iberia. Our direct land-sea comparison shows that the expression of the suborbital cooling events on SW Iberian ecosystems is modulated by the predominance of high or low-latitude forcing depending on the glacial/interglacial baseline climate states. Severe dryness and air-sea cooling is detected under the larger ice volume during glacial MIS 32 and MIS 30. The extreme episodes, which in their climatic imprint are similar to the Heinrich events, are likely related to northern latitude ice-sheet instability and a disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In contrast, forest declines during MIS 31 are associated to neither SST cooling nor high-latitude freshwater forcing. Time-series analysis reveals a dominant cyclicity of about 6 ky in the temperate forest record, which points to a potential link with the fourth harmonic of precession and thus low-latitude insolation forcing.

Evidence of how people dealt or failed to deal with it has only recently become a more widespread focus for archaeologists. Investigations at Xcoch in the Puuc Hills show the various ways in which resident populations sought to manage water stores when faced with a climate prone to drought and other meteorological extremes. The study also presents results from the analysis of nearby speleothem laminae, which indicate that severe episodes of flooding and droughts may have contributed to a collapse in the population around AD 850.

The first settlement occurred during the second millennium cal BCE, and this late human occupation is associated with insularity factors, including an extreme environment. Cap de Barbaria II is one of the biggest open-air naviform villages occupied during the first prehistoric settlement and for an extended period (ca. 1600-850 cal BCE). Multidisciplinary archaeological research conducted within the site reveals adaptation of the economic behaviour of these first settlers to an environment poor in resources. In this sense, aspects such as innovation, diversification, and intensification in the use of resources characterized the subsistence and technological patterns developed by the prehistoric inhabitants of Formentera. New data from different archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies, such as archaeobotanical, archaeozoological, or technological and functional, have been analyzed. In this sense, the assessed subsistence patterns, reveal adaptive strategies that encompass different local and exogenous resources and differ from those observed in the rest of the Balearic Islands.

The organic matter of endolithic and hypolithic systems, soils of wind shelters, and soils under moss-algae vegetation were dated along with micro-and macroprofiles. Organic matter pools formed under extreme climatic conditions and originated not from vascular plants but from cryptogamic organisms, and photoautotrophic microbes have been identified within the oases of the East Antarctica. The organic matter of the most of East Antarctic soils is young and cannot reach a steady state because of the high dynamism in the soil cover due to active erosion. The oldest soil organic matter in East Antarctica was found in the soils formed in wind shelters and endolithic soil-like systems under the protection of consolidated rock surfaces. According to our data, the maximal duration for the formation of organic matter profiles within the oases of East Antarctica is similar to 500 yr, which is similar to the age determined for High Arctic soils in Eurasia. The absence of older soils, comparable with the Holocene deglaciation, can be due to the extreme conditions resulting in occasional catastrophic events that destroyed the soil organic horizons.

A sediment core from Kukkal Lake preserves a continuous sediment record from the early-Holocene to present (9000 yr BP to present). The present lake is situated at an elevation of similar to 1887m a.s.l., in a small basin that appears to have alternated between a and wetland depositional environment. Climate proxies, including sediment texture, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N, pollen and geochemical composition indicate a steady progression to wetter conditions, with two stepwise changes at about 8000, and between 3200 and 1800 yr BP. The change at 8000 yr BP appears to correspond to a brief (100-150years) dry spell recorded elsewhere in India. The change at 3200-1800 yr BP consisted in a rapid intensification of the SWM, and may correlate with the initiation of the Roman Warm Period'. There is no clear evidence of changes at the times of the Medieval Warm Period' (MWP') and the Little Ice Age' (LIA'). The C/N ratio of the sediments ranges from 14.02 to 8.31, indicating that the organic matter originated from a mixture of lacustrine algae, vascular and terrestrial plants. Chemical weathering indices (Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW), and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA)) are consistent with extreme silicate weathering. Pollen data show a development from savanna vegetation prior to about 8000 yr BP, followed by grassland with palms, the appearance of ferns just prior to 3200 yr BP and the establishment of the tropical humid forest between 3200 and about 1800 yr BP.

Estuarine-inner shelf mud regions deposited from rivers that transport a large amount of suspended sediment represent an important archive of the Holocene. Two cores (S5-2 and JC07) retrieved from the estuarine-inner shelf regions of the East China Sea provided an opportunity to use sensitive grain size and Pb-210 dating to reconstruct a history of extreme weather events in the Yangtze River basin. Here, we show that the average sedimentation rates of the two cores, S5-2 (1930-2013) and JC07 (1910-2013), were estimated to be 3.11 and 1.56cm/yr, respectively. The results indicated that sediment supply played an important role in sedimentation of the estuarine-inner shelf mud region of the East China Sea. Sand content strongly increased in the late 1980s, a result of downstream riverbed erosion of the Yangtze River and submerged deltas. The grain size versus the standard deviation method was used to identify grain-size intervals with the highest variability along a sedimentary sequence. The Yangtze estuary mud area coarse population correlated well with historical literature on Yangtze River floods since AD 1930. Extreme storm events corresponded well with historical literature on the Zhe-Min mud region of the East China Sea. The spectral analyses of the sample core coastal population demonstrated that flood and storm events were consistent with a similar to 3-8a periodic change of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), suggesting that the flood events usually follow ENSO years in the Yangtze River. Consequently, sediment records preserved in the two cores demonstrated different sedimentary responses to Yangtze River floods and storms, which is important to recover centennial scale flood events, to infer extreme precipitation, and to understand climate change in the estuarine-inner shelf of the East China Sea. Nevertheless, more efforts are still needed to simulate paleo-flood and predict future flood events in the context of global warming.

Sediments with larger grain size, lower total organic carbon percentage, and depleted delta C-13 values in the recovered sediment cores were interpreted as periods of more frequent flooding. Patterns of decreased long-term flooding frequency and vegetation changes during the early to late Holocene were similar to the decreasing regional summer monsoon intensity. Multicentennial frequent flooding periods in the study area (2900-3400 cal yr BP, 3600-3900 cal yr BP, 4600-5300 cal yr BP, and 5800-6400 cal yr BP) corresponded to stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity periods. Based on previous studies showing that high-frequency tropical typhoon-driven coastal inundation along the western coast of Japan during the middle to late Holocene was coupled with stronger ENSO activity, it is likely that the observed centennial-to-millennial- scale flood frequency change in South Korea was influenced mainly by changes in the genesis and tracks of tropical typhoons at centennial-to-millennial time scales. This suggests that the centennial-to-millennial-scale hydrologic changes in East Asia were linked to the remote atmospheric-oceanic circulation changes represented by an ENSO-like pattern.

Beginning in the Early Upper Paleolithic of Europe, bladelet (a.k.a. microblade) elements used as edges, barbs or tips were added to the repertoire of weapon technology. Various forms thereof are present in Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian assemblages. In the Solutrean, they are found together with large stone points (foliate, shouldered, stemmed), presumably used on different kinds of weapons (thrusting spears, hand-thrown javelins, atl-atl darts and perhaps even bow-propelled arrows). These different kinds of weapon systems existed throughout the Upper Paleolithic under both stadial and interstadial conditions and, once invented (or re-invented) seem to have been variations on the same classes of projectiles whose functional distinctions remain to be identified. Nonetheless, in the Solutrean context during the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 25-20 cal ka), developments in weaponry (including the use of bladelets along with the better-known Solutrean points) were parts of a suite of adaptations to extreme environmental conditions ranging from territorial contraction into refugia in SW Europe to subsistence intensification.

Here we report on a series of high latitude late Pleistocene sites in south-west Tasmania, where the conjunction of cultural activities and long term environmental change have preserved rich deposits in a number of cave sites. These data are used to test the utility of several models within optimal foraging theory. The data indicate the intensive and selective pursuit of two mid-size mammals, the Bennett's wallaby and the wombat, at the expense of other prey species that were also likely present. Hunting patterns involved the scheduled seasonal use of lowland and upland valley sites underwriting a regional strategy of moving between focal hunting locations to maximise returns. This strategy continued with little change from c. 40,000 BP to 15,000 BP, providing a stable, predictable and secure food source for people through a period of extreme climatic change. The benefits and limitations of the behavioural ecology models used in this study indicate their utility where the data are sufficiently robust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Concerning such relationships, well documented and well dated references from sedimentary records are rather rare. The developments within the lower Jarama Valley have been significantly supported by an interaction of tectonic activity, evaporite dissolution, and halokinetics that initiated rapid vertical movements over short distances and caused the formation of knick-points and gradient changes along the longitudinal floodplain profile. Furthermore, the specific Mediterranean climate caused highly variable discharges including extreme runoff peaks. The juxtaposition of different floodplain gradients gave rise to spatial and temporal changes of discharge patterns and channel geometry, which is reflected by varying sedimentation as well as erosion patterns. We have been able to confirm that alluvial thickening due to intense dissolution and subsidence has been a characteristic and frequently recurring feature during the Pleistocene. Moreover, we want to emphasize that also during the Holocene gradient adjustments exercised controlling influence on fluvial dynamics, in particular with regard to channel response. In fact, we found consistency between low and moderate gradients and meandering single channel patterns associated with overbank deposition in distal floodplain positions. Only a section with stronger inclination revealed evidences for multiple channel discharge patterns in form of gravelly braided river deposits. In comparison with recent discharge patterns and information from historical sources it appears that braided river deposition took place just within a short time frame between 5 and 3 ka cal. BP. This matches exactly a period of strong climatic aridity including highly variable precipitation and discharge patterns. From that we conclude, that in the first instance, gradient changes promoted the change of channel and discharge patterns, but however, specific overlap of the parameters gradient and runoff is considered to have been necessary to generate braided discharge pattern. A subsequent formation of braided patterns during the Late Holocene was presumably prevented by river entrenchment as well as a strong increase of sediment availability during the time of Roman colonization. On the basis of this study, we can establish a number of general relationships between floodplain gradient, runoff pattern, and channel response during the Holocene period that may help us to better understand fluvial behavior in various different areas.

We document windward vs. leeward islet site variation in the taxonomic composition of fish bone and mollusc shell assemblages from three archaeological sites at Ebon Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, to elucidate the relationship between local environment, archaeological site type and the taxonomic composition of marine archaeofaunal assemblages. While the representation of taxa at each site was broadly similar in terms of measures of taxonomic heterogeneity (richness, evenness and dominance), chord distance and correspondence analysis reported variation in taxonomic composition at each site. For mollusc shell assemblages, variation in taxonomic abundance indicates the influence of the marine environments adjacent to each site and the relative exposure of these coastlines to heavy surf, wind, waves and extreme weather events. Fish bone assemblages recovered from 6.4 mm screens had less inter-site variation in richness, evenness and rank order, but differences were noted in the rank order of fish taxa recovered from selective 3.2 mm screening of archaeological deposits when compared between sites. In contrast to patterns for molluscs, variation in the taxonomic composition of fish bone assemblages likely relates to site function, rather than the marine environments adjacent to each site. These trends highlight for the first time the complex range of factors that influenced the prehistoric acquisition of marine resources between leeward and windward islets, and document variation in prehistoric marine subsistence within one atoll.

Three phases of wetland development are identified, with a protected coastal setting from ca. 2400 to 500 years ago, transitioning into an estuarine mangrove forest from ca. 500 years ago to the 1940s, and finally to a freshwater swamp over the past +60 years. This sequence reflects the influence of falling sea-levels, development of a coastal dune barrier system, prograding shorelines, and an extreme storm (cyclone) event. In addition, there is clear evidence of the impacts that human abandonment and resettlement have on the island's fire regimes and vegetation. A dramatic increase in burning and vegetation thickening was observed after the cessation of traditional Indigenous Kaiadilt fire management practices in the 1940s, and was then reversed when people returned to the island in the 1980s. In terms of the longer context for human occupation of the South Wellesley Archipelago, it is apparent that the mangrove phase provided a stable and productive environment that was conducive for human settlement of this region over the past 1000 years.

We ran the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test to detect trends in hydrological extremes. We also applied the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA), to assess flow regime variations. The results indicate that: (1) the hydrological extremes in headwater experienced increases in magnitude, duration, and high flow frequency; the mainstream exhibited increases in low flow duration and low flow frequency, and a decrease in high percentile flow and high flow frequency; (2) The trends of extremes related to minimum flow is greater than maximum flow; the date of maximum flow in both the headwater and mainstream has advanced; the most drastic changes in extreme streamflow occurred during winter; (3) Climate change has considerably altered flow regime in the headwater. Although climate change has profoundly affected the water supply upstream, human activities are dominant in determining flow regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

According to IPCC (2012) the extreme events are rarest of the rare weather/climatic events when the climate/weather variable is significantly above or below the defined threshold value. The present study suggests that paleovalleys can also form during years long periods of valley aggradation. A series of paleovalleys thus formed runs parallel to the present river course. In this study, we suggest that paleovalleys in the Alaknanda valley of the Central Himalaya have formed in two ways: 1) major valley aggradation and 2) local events of landsliding and lake breaching. Most of the paleovalleys in the Alaknanda valley formed during a major valley aggradation phase (between 15 and 8 ka). Paleovalleys formed due to local landsliding also formed around 8 ka. Local landslides were triggered due to high rainfall in lower valley reaches during unstable climatic conditions. Therefore, the formation of paleovalleys both by regional and local mode within 15-8 ka indicates that the valley was receiving excess sediment from upper catchment as well as from lower reaches during this period. This phase of excess sediment supply and valley aggradation coincides well with post glacial climatic amelioration. Therefore the study underlines the role of climate in the time scales of 103 years in shaping the landscape of an active mountain like the Himalaya. The role of other landscape changing agencies such as tectonics and erosion is not accounted in the present study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

As summer precipitation in Portugal is scarce and irregular, it is not considered. A consistency analysis of the calibrated time series is then undertaken using: (1) precipitation indices for Portugal in 1675-1799; (2) teleconnections between seasonal precipitation and large-scale atmospheric flow; (3) two paleoclimatic experiments (ERIK1 and ERIK2), generated from a global/regional climate model chain (ECHO-G/MM5); and (4) tree-ring records from oak trees in Portugal (Serra do Bucaco). These are the first multi-centennial records of tree-ring growth in Portugal (the earliest series begin in 1675). General agreement is found between indices and calibrated precipitation for their common period on an annual basis. Overall, the atmospheric teleconnection patterns are dynamically coherent between the instrumental and pre-instrumental periods. The inter-annual to inter-decadal variability in the calibrated series reveals similar distributions as in the paleoclimatic simulations. Low-frequency variability in spring precipitation is validated by 12 tree-ring series. This study provides calibrated seasonal precipitation series in Portugal from 1600 onwards, revealing high consistency with several independent sources for winter and spring, enabling future applications to climate research.

However, the plain faunal turnover rate is related to species richness, and therefore a faunal turnover index ( 100 Chi faunal turnover rate/species richness) is used. The changes in these values are studied for large mammals of the past 24 My of Western Europe and past 20 My of Africa. In Africa and in Western Europe, discrete events of acceleration of the rate of faunal change occurred at different moments and as responses to different climatic events. In Africa, an abrupt decrease in average species longevity and a very moderate increase in the index of faunal turnover occurred around 7.5 Ma, followed by a spectacular increase in species richness ( and plain faunal turnover rates). These events are probably related to the increasing abundance of C-4 grasses. In Europe an overall trend in decreasing average species longevity set in after 9 Ma, accelerated around 2.5 and reached very low values around 0.01 Ma, while plain faunal turnover rates and the faunal turnover index increased from 1.2 Ma onward and reached extreme values during the later Pleistocene. These changes are probably related to the overall cooling trend and the increasing importance of the Milankovich cycles of obliquity around 2.6 Ma and eccentricity around 1.2-0.9 Ma. The acceleration in faunal change in Africa is more or less coincident with the first fossil record indicating bipedalism in hominoids. The first human dispersal into Europe occurred against a background of accelerating faunal change. The later Pleistocene to Holocene is a period of intense faunal change. Neanderthals lived and evolved in this changing environment until their replacement by our own species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Particle sizes were measured in 6-15 year intervals in post-1870 sediments and in 45-170 year intervals in pre-1870 sediments using an automatic laser analyzer. The sedimentological characteristics of ad 1948-2009 deposits were compared with gaging records, demonstrating that fine sand content and sorting discern time intervals of large floods, but flood magnitudes are not well resolved. This modern analog was applied to pre-1870 sediments and revealed two periods in the last 2000 years with large floods during ad 650-850 and ad 1100-1350, which are times when the regional tree-ring record showed extreme wetness and no severe or extreme droughts. Our findings indicate flood-prone phases of transitional climate at the beginning and end of the 'Medieval Warm Period' (MWP), and relatively subdued flooding during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA), possibly correlated with rearrangement of macro-scale atmospheric circulation patterns between the MWP and the LIA.

LIA was characterized by marked climatic variability over this part of southern Europe, particularly during the MM. Using a model based on adding subregional details to regional-scale reconstruction, we estimated for this period a mean winter temperature of similar to 1 degrees C lower than in the baseline period 1961-1990 (similar to 8 degrees C), and the anomaly further lowered down to about -4 degrees C in the winter of 1683-1684. In addition, the interannual variability of extreme low temperatures makes the MM an outstanding climatic period. There is also some consistency of the empirical evidence with the modelling results that, for high-resolution wintertime seasonal reconstruction, central Mediterranean Sub-regional Area shows a colder climate than that represented by coarser simulation of European temperatures during the LIA period.

Influence of natural catastrophes on the development of Southern Kuril Island landscapes in the Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							TSUNAMI DEPOSITS; JAPAN; HOKKAIDO	Southern Kuril Islands are situated within a geodynamically active zone noteworthy for an exceedingly high concentration of catastrophic events. Besides those arising from tectonic regime of the region, such as volcanism, earthquakes and tsunami, some extreme events of climatic nature occur repeatedly, including typhoons and related floods, and violent storms. Impact of those catastrophic factors on the environmental evolution was conspicuous against the background of long-term climatic changes, often concealing influence of the latter or reversing temporarily the direction of natural development. Those factors are of special importance on relatively small islands. A sequence of various short-term catastrophic events could even exert an irreversible effect on landscape evolution and occasionally trigger cardinal restructuring of environments. Particularly important consequences occur from events that involve a momentary (in terms of geological time) input of huge masses of loose material: they disturb stable trends in the landscape evolution (primarily that of lithogenic base of the landscapes, namely landforms and deposits). Judging from the structure of the loose sediment mantle on the islands, catastrophic events varied over wide ranges of intensity and frequency during the Holocene. On the whole, their occurrence agreed with phases of tectonic and volcanic activity in the volcanic belt of the Northwestern Pacific. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

After the formation of wide unpaired meander terraces during the Early Holocene, the river created a 20-m-deep gorge into bedrock in its inner part. In mid-valley, the thalweg progressively enlarges and the Late Pleistocene and Holocene terraces converge downstream. A wide alluvial plain was formed during braid-plain aggradation from ca. 4.3 BP, to the end of the 19th century, associated with slope erosion activated by human activities. Since the end of the 20th century, two series of artificial levees were created in order to prevent floods. Due to the reduced dimensions of the artificial river bed, floods still affect large parts of the plain after extreme events. In the coastal sector, during the Early Holocene, a large bay extended approximately 3 km inland from the present-day coastline. A barrier beach evolved during the Bronze-Iron Age and, until the Middle Ages, the river mouth entered a large lagoon. Progradation occurred from then until the beginning of the 20th century, when a delta extended up to 500 m seaward. During the 20th century, following the creation of the artificial levees and quarrying the beach underwent coastal erosion, and had to be protected by breakwater reefs. The anthropogenic modifications and their effects are among the main factors in the Holocene evolution of the landscape. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

ETNA; VOLCANO	On the eastern flank of Etna volcano, movements along the NNW-SSE trending normal faults of the Timpe system generate recurrent, low magnitude very shallow seismic events that induce noteworthy ground surface effects. The Timpe system is the on-land extension of the Hyblean-Malta fault system, which is the likely source of the 1693 Maw 7.4 earthquake. Frequent creep phenomena occur both associated with seismic events and/or volcanic eruptions, and independent from them. These surface deformations are mainly confined in the eastern sector of the volcano apparatus and result from the interaction between regional tectonics and local volcano-tectonic processes. The widespread diffusion of cultural sites in this region even before the Greek civilisation testifies to the complex relationship of humans with a restless violent nature. Many Greek authors and myths refer to the frightening eruptions and earthquakes of Etna, but, at the same time, Strabo underlines the extreme fertility of the land due to the volcanic ash, and the quality of the local wine. So notwithstanding the evident risk, this region is one of the most densely inhabited regions of Sicily. Coseismic surface ruptures and creep are responsible for damaging effects on buildings, roads, railways and lifelines, including the water supply network. To reduce the environmental risk from faulting, APAT-Italian Agency for Environment Protection and for Technical Services-has compiled a georeferenced database, where capable faults, extract from ITHACA (Italy Hazard from Capable Faults) catalogue, and water supply and other environmentally sensible networks are overlapped to pinpoint zones of expected damage. This tool is fundamental in land planning and during an emergency, as seen during the 2002 Santa Venerina earthquake when the environmental agency needed to quickly verify the integrity of the water distribution and sewage networks.

Here, we present a detailed record of the development of regional vegetation in the northern margin of Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation (16,500-11,000 cal yr BP) based on a radiocarbon-dated high-resolution pollen record from Hulun Lake, northeast China. The results show that the regional vegetation changed from subalpine meadow-desert steppe to mixed coniferous and deciduous forest-typical steppe during the last deglaciation. However, its responses to the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the Younger Dryas event (YD) were significantly different: during the H1 event, scattered sparse forest was present in the surrounding mountains, while within the lake catchment the vegetation cover was poor and was dominated by desert steppe. In contrast, during the YD event, deciduous forest developed and the proportion of coniferous forest increased in the mountains, the lake catchment was occupied by typical steppe. We suggest that changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and land surface conditions (ice sheets and sea level) caused temperature and monsoonal precipitation variations that contributed to the contrasting vegetation response during the two cold events. We conclude that under future global warming scenarios, extreme climatic events may cause a deterioration of the ecological environment of the Hulun Lake region, resulting in increased coniferous forest and decreased total forest cover in the surrounding mountains, and a reduction in typical steppe in the lake catchment.

Dynamics of fire, precipitation, vegetation and NDVI in dry forest environments in NW Argentina. Contributions to environmental archaeology	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Fire; Precipitation; NVDI; Hindcasting model; Environmental archaeology; Remote sensing; Northwestern Argentina	AMBATO VALLEY CATAMARCA; GREAT-PLAINS; NOAA AVHRR; SATELLITE; CLIMATE; SAHEL; ECOSYSTEM; HISTORY; DESERT; PLANT	Fire has shaped the environment and has been important for human cultural development. In this paper, we propose to study past fire events using ecological modelling. For instance, the ecology of fire can help us to understand and interpret archaeological problems related to past settlement patterns or environmental scenarios. Variation in fire regimens are related to both, vegetation and precipitation fluctuations. Recently, we have model past ecosystem dynamics using remote sensing in the Ambato Valley (Catamarca NW Argentina) ranging from 442 to 1998 CE. Our aim here is to use remotely sensed vegetation data to enhance our understanding of environmental disturbance in the period 2000-2011. We characterised the spatial-time dynamics of the annual NDVI as an indicator of vegetation functioning. Then we related the NDVI dynamics to precipitation and fire events in an arid highland environment in the area. Further, we analysed the vegetation data (monthly NDVI, MODIS/ TERRA satellite, 1km(2) pixels), and the climate data: annual precipitation. Then we calculated the NDVI annual average of every pixel and the NDVI anomalies of every year over the studied period. Lastly, we related NDVI data with annual precipitation and compared the NDVIs prior to and after known fire events in this period. On a spatial scale, the results show that the NDVI values were (a) low in shrublands and in cultivated areas, (b) medium in grasslands and piedmont forest with anthropic impact, and (c) high in highland forests. Within the studied time-period, extreme positive and negative anomalies were detected. The precipitation interannual variations were greater than the NDVI inter-annual variations, thus demonstrating that in some areas of the valley the horizontal precipitation can make important contributions to the ecosystem humidity. Extreme negative anomalies were observed the year of fire and fire scars at least for the next two years. These results demonstrate the relation between structure and function of vegetation, precipitation and fire. Understanding these relations can enable us to explain results when hindcasting ("predicting" what happened during past episodes of climate change) palaeoenvironmental conditions and fire events, thus helping us to interpret different archaeological contexts related to fire events.

Here, we present a well-dated, late Holocene Dead Sea sediment record of debris flows covering 3.3 to 1.9 cal ka BP. Twenty-three graded layers deposited in shallow waters near the western Dead Sea shore were identified by microfacies analysis. These layers represent distal subaquatic deposits of debris flows triggered by torrential rainstorms over the adjacent western Dead Sea escarpment. Modern debris flows on this escarpment are induced by rare rainstorms with intensities exceeding > 30 mm h(-1) for at least one hour and originate primarily from the Active Red Sea Trough synoptic pattern. The observed late Holocene clustering of such debris flows during a regional drought indicates an increased influence of Active Red Sea Troughs resulting from a shift in synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns. This shift likely decreased the passages of eastern Mediterranean cyclones, leading to drier conditions, but favored rainstorms triggered by the Active Red Sea Trough. This is in accord with present-day meteorological data showing an increased frequency of torrential rainstorms in regions of drier climate. Hence, this study provides conclusive evidence for a shift in synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns during a late Holocene drought.

Hominin groups are present on the landscape during the coldest episodes of the Last Glacial Period. Moreover, the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (IAMC) likely served as a geographic conduit for human groups that found refuge in the foothill regions of the Altai Mountains as well as those of the southwestern horn of the Tien Shan; this conduit can be construed as the stage upon which hominin admixture occurred. The present study broadens the geographic focus of previous work to include the steppe and steppe/desert zones immediately adjacent to the biologically productive foothills of the IAMC. Using an ecological threshold model, four abiotic variables that best predict hominin site locations are analyzed to examine differences in fundamental niche structure when the IAMC foothills are compared to the adjacent steppic zones. Our null hypothesis is that the foothills and adjacent steppe present similar abiotic profiles. Our results, however, indicate significant differences between these regions, suggesting the foothills would have presented hominins with a more attractive landscape in both glacial and interglacial time periods than the steppe. Counterintuitively, these differences are actually more extreme during interglacial time periods. This preliminary model of hominin-environment interactions serves as a useful example for the ways by which mid-scale hominin dispersal trajectories are mapped and interpreted.

Discovery of the skull of Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Jager, 1839) above the Arctic Circle	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Stephanorhinus; Skull; Diet; Genome; Extreme NE Russia	MAMMALIA; RHINOCEROTIDAE; RADIOCARBON; COLLAGEN; SIBERIA; REGION; GRASS; CAVE; PERISSODACTYLA; PRESERVATION	The skull of the extinct rhinoceros Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Jager, 1839) was discovered in the Chondon River valley (Arctic Yakutia, Russia) during the summer of 2014. This is the first find of Stephanorhinus above the Arctic Circle, expanding significantly the known geographic range of the genus. C-14 dating and geologic evidence indicate that the skull dates to between 48,000 and 70,000 yr, corresponding to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 4/3. It is thus among the latest records of this species. To explore the evolutionary and natural history of this relatively unknown animal, we performed morphological, dietary, and genetic analyses. Phylogenetic inference based on a complete mitochondrial genome sequence confirms the systematic placement of Stephanorhinus as most closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros, Coelodonta. Food remains in the fossas of the cheek teeth, identified as Larix, Vaccinium, Betula sp., Aulacomnium, and dicotyledonous herbs and grasses, suggest a mixed feeder's diet. Microwear analysis suggests that, during the last months of its life, this individual fed predominantly on leaves and twigs. The habitat of Stephanorhinus comprised grassland and open woodland that were characterized by moist and cold climate conditions, similar to those in the region today.

While historic data show that floods occurred frequently in the Yongding River in China and have caused many natural disasters. The sedimentologic records of palaeoflood in the Yongding River have not been well studied. This study investigates the palaeoflood deposits at the Tanmugou site in the middle reach of the Yongding River. Six episodes of palaeoflood were identified in the sediment profile. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating method was applied to establish the chronology of the palaeoflood deposits. Both the improved single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol and standard growth curve (SGC) method were employed for equivalent dose (D-e) determinations. The minimum age model (MAM), central age model (CAM) and arithmetic mean were applied to calculate the De values. The OSL dating results show that these palaeoflood events occurred in the Holocene and concentrated during three stages, including 8.5 -7.3 ka, 2.8-2.4 ka and 1-0.5 ka. The timings of these palaeoflood events in the Yongding River coincide with the timings of palaeoflood events in other river systems in China. Compared with the continuously high-resolution climate record in China, these palaeoflood events occurred during climate transition periods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Correlated bulk organic and biogenic silica proxy data demonstrated high-amplitude changes from 125 to 71 ka, suggesting that summer insolation directly influenced lake productivity during MIS 5. From 60 to 57 ka, hydrologic state changes and events occurred in California and the U.S. Southwest, though the pattern of response varied geographically. Intermediate, less variable levels of winter and summer insolation followed during MIS 3 (57-29 ka), which likely maintained moist conditions in Southern California that were punctuated with smaller order, millennial-scale events. These Dansgaard-Oeschger events brought enhanced surface temperatures (SSTs) to the eastern Pacific margin, and aridity to sensitive terrestrial sites in the Southwest and Southern California. Low temperatures and reduced evaporation are widespread during MIS 2, though there is increasing evidence for moisture extremes in Southern California from 29 to 20 ka. Our record shows that both orbital-scale radiative forcing and rapid North Atlantic temperature perturbations were likely influences on Southern California climate prior to the last glacial. However, these forcings produced a hydroclimatic response throughout California and the U.S. Southwest that was geographically complex. This work highlights that it is especially urgent to improve our understanding of the response to rapid climatic change in these regions. Enhanced temperature and aridity are projected for the rest of the 21st century, which will place stress on water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Testing Greco-Roman medicinal minerals: The case of solfataric alum	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Greco-Roman medicinal minerals; Solfataric alum; Melos; Campi Flegrei, Naples; Antibacterial; Efflorescence	CAMPI FLEGREI; MILOS ISLAND; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; DEPOSITS; MELOS; WATER; HALLOYSITE; VOLCANO; SPAS; AREA	The medicinal minerals of antiquity reported in Greco-Latin texts are now understood to consist primarily of layered silicates, sulphates and metal oxides/sulphides, normally not in their natural state but following some processing. Recent microbiological work on layered silicates from some volcanic islands in the Aegean (Samos) and on samples of archaeological earths in museum collections (terra sigillata, Lemnos), has shown them to be antibacterial. This paper focuses on aluminium sulphates and in particular solfataric alum efflorescences, known to have been worked in the antiquity and later periods. The results suggest that solfataric alum consists primarily of the minerals alunogen and alum-(K) and displays strong antibacterial properties. Given that presently there is a drive to discover and develop new drugs (antibacterials) from 'extreme' environments, we suggest that an understanding of the nature and properties of sulphate-based Greco-Roman medicinal minerals in the context of the volcanic landscapes from which they derive may prove to be a worthwhile task. This paper sets the mineralogical background to some of these potentially important antibacterials, prior to delving into further microbiological work, currently underway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine shield designs in the rock art of two visually similar engraved art provinces on opposite sides of the Australian continent: Port Hedland and Sydney. We explore the question of inter-group social signalling behaviour in arid versus fertile environments by testing the stylistic heterogeneity of shield designs in both art provinces. We examine the stylistic diversity of historically-collected and illustrated shields from both regions, and compare these with the engraved repertoires of the two style provinces. One of the precepts of information exchange theory (IET) is that publicly-displayed items/artefacts will provide the best vehicles for projecting cultural identity information. We assume that shields, as items of material culture which are carried publically, would have been ideally suited to signal individual, local and broader group identity. In more fertile areas it is usually argued that hunter-gatherers demonstrate increased territoriality and social boundedness as a result of demographic packing and focused resources, compared to groups in arid areas where there are widely ramified social networks. We test the hypothesis that a greater degree of stylistic heterogeneity should be displayed by engraved Sydney shields compared with those found in Port Hedland. However, our analyses demonstrate the reverse of this prediction. We suggest some alternative explanations for how style has been used in the arid coastal Pilbara, and suggest refinement is needed of some expectations in information exchange theory in arid zones where there is focalised resource availability and extreme language hybridity.

There are only two published radiocarbon ages by far for chronological control. Recently, a new section (Gangcha section) was found, with abundant charcoals and fish bones well-preserved in the matrix of aeolian sediments, providing a good opportunity for a combined study of luminescence and radiocarbon dating. In the current study, we obtained three luminescence ages on aeolian sediment, six radiocarbon ages (three on charcoals and three on fish bones). Our results showed that the luminescence ages (average of 3.2 +/- 0.2 ka) are in agreement with charcoal radiocarbon ages (3165-3273 cal a BP) where applicable, and that the lake reservoir effect age of radiocarbon dating was approximately 0.3-0.7 cal ka BP and an average of 0.4 cal ka BP at similar to 3.2 cal ka BP (age difference between that of charcoals and fish bones). The prehistoric residence in Qinghai Lake area seemed to be sequenced from 15 ka BP to 3.1 ka BP, based on our data and previously published data altogether. The obvious baked vestiges on the bones of fish and animals, as well as a number of artifacts, indicate that naked carps had become a food resource for prehistoric people at least since 3.2 cal ka BP.

Identifying integrative built environments in the archaeological record: An application of New Urban Design Theory to ancient urban spaces	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Built environment; Integration; Community; New Urban Design Theory; Maya	NEIGHBORHOOD; ATTACHMENT; POWER; COMMUNITY; IDEOLOGY; IDENTITY; CITIES; FORM; FOOD	Ancient Maya settlement patterns have long been described as dispersed. Instances of low-density or dispersed urbanism among agrarian-based societies are common in tropical civilizations, and are of particular interest due to their expressed problem of social integration. Traditionally, archaeologists have focused on classic hallmarks of state integration, including force, infrastructural control, large-scale ritual, and kinship; thus, reflecting the polar extremes of integration. Current models accord a more multi-scalar and dynamic nature to state and urban organization, and the need to pursue diachronic perspectives that consider more subtle and varied degrees of integration. With regard to settlement, examining the total patch of occupation on a landscape, how it developed, how it was divided up, and in turn brought together, is of interest. In this study I apply criteria developed in New Urban Design Theory, a body of thought and practice concerned with modern-day issues of dispersed and low density settlement, to evaluate an architectural complex at the Classic Maya centre of Buenavista del Cayo, Belize, believed to have functioned as an integrative space within the civic entity.

Diatom-inferred changes in effective moisture during the late Holocene from nearshore cores in the southeastern region of the Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (Canada)	HOLOCENE			English	Article						boreal; diatoms; lake level; late Holocene; 'Medieval Climate Anomaly'; northwest Ontario	EXPERIMENTAL LAKES AREA; NORTH-AMERICAN DROUGHT; NEBRASKA SAND HILLS; LONG-TERM CHANGES; WATER-DEPTH; NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO; BOREAL LAKES; ICE-AGE; ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE	The Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB), within the boreal forest region of northwest Ontario, is a region that is expected to be negatively affected by climate warming. Inferences of droughts over the past two millennia from Little Raleigh Lake were based on two nearshore sediment cores. The core locations were from depths of similar to 12 and 15 m and were based on sufficient nearshore sediment accumulation and distance from the modern benthic-toplanktonic diatom boundary, where a distinct shift from dominance of benthic taxa changed to dominance of planktonic taxa in surficial sediments at similar to 11.8 m. Diatom-inferred depth was based on a model developed from 60 surficial sediments within the study lake. Depth inferences indicate that prolonged periods of aridity occurred from similar to AD 950 to 1300 (corresponds to 'Medieval Climate Anomaly') and from similar to AD 1625 to 1750 (aridity during 'Little Ice Age'). We found that the core collected from a depth closer to the benthic-to-planktonic diatom boundary was more sensitive to changes in lake level than the deeper core where planktonic diatoms dominated the assemblage. The inferred low-water stands of the past two millennia are well outside of the range of the past similar to 100 years, suggesting that recent drought history may not be a good estimate of future extremes.

Lewis and Clarks' Tempest: The 'perfect storm' of November 1805, Oregon, USA	HOLOCENE			English	Article						dendroclimatology; dendroecology; Lewis and Clark; Pacific Northwest; Sitka spruce; windstorms	FOREST DAMAGE; WINDSTORM; COLORADO	Three weeks after arriving near the Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast in November 1805, Lewis and Clarks' Corps of Discovery experienced a two-day windstorm that may have rivaled the strongest historically documented storms of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Based on the Corps' detailed historical accounts describing the event as the perfect storm, we characterized the severity of the 1805 windstorm using tree-ring growth anomalies from windsnapped Sitka spruce collected at three sites along the northern Oregon Coast. We compared the 1805 gale to eight other documented events with comparable storm tracks and exceptional magnitude including the 1880 and 1951 events that each caused more than a billion board feet (c. 2.4 million m(3)) of windthrow. Statistical comparison of tree-growth responses revealed that the 1805 windstorm was the only event to differ significantly (chi(2); test, p < 0.05, d.f. = 1) from all other storms. Our findings demonstrate the potential application of tree-ring data and historical documents to understand previously obscure climatic events similar to the extreme droughts that led to the demise of the Roanoke Colony during the sixteenth century and adversity experienced by the Jamestown Colony during the seventeenth century. Specifically, we identify the Lewis and Clark tempest of 1805 as being among the most severe PNW windstorms during the past two centuries, and may have contributed to the Corps' dismal view of coastal Pacific Northwest weather.

As has been happening for artefact preservation in museums, the idea is to develop systems based on the ability of some highly hygroscopic materials to moderate variations in relative humidity. These materials could adsorb and release moisture to reduce the extreme values of humidity in the micro-climate, for example between wooden beams and masonry. In order to experimentally verify this possibility using current, low cost and easy handling building materials, 5 bentonite samples were laboratory processed to improve their adsorbing properties by means of treatment with sodium carbonate at 3 concentrations: 2, 3 and 4% by weight. The effectiveness of ion exchange between sodium carbonate and bentonite was controlled by measuring the swelling volume of the bentonites. All the samples (n = 15) were tested for their hygroscopic properties. Adsorption isotherms were measured at 25 degrees C, using desiccators with silica gel, saturated salt solutions and bi-distilled water. A comparison between isotherms of one of the lower hygroscopic treated sample of bentonite and of a sample of wood and of a sample of brick and some numerical analyses with the Delphin code were made in order to evaluate the potential use of this bentonite as a moisture regulating system for the preservation of historical wooden elements. Results show that it seems to be possible to use bentonites as a moisture buffering material in order to reduce moisture content in wooden beams at least during their adsorption phase. It remains to investigate their desorption phase and their behaviour if they be in a saturation condition. Further studies are currently under way. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Archaeological and geologic evidence was used in the 1970s by R. L. Folk to develop a scenario of local environmental degradation, resulting from a postulated widespread climate change (4th-8th centuries A.D.), as a major cause of the decline and eventual abandonment of Stobi. The data for increasingly xeric conditions, catastrophic floods, and mudslides along the Crna River are reviewed and other paleoenvironmental evidence is considered. Subsequent archaeological investigations and a refined chronology reveal repeated episodes of rebuilding along the Crna between periods of flooding. After that portion of the city was abandoned in the mid-5th century, Stobi achieved new prosperity as reflected in the construction of large-scale ecclesiastical architecture and houses outside the south city wall. Human agency and periodic extreme weather are proposed as causes of environmental degradation at Stobi. The city's demise is attributed mainly to hostile invasions, plague, earthquake, and the collapse of imperial administrative and economic networks. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of intense rainfalls and their recurrence: Case study in Corralito ravine, Cordoba Province, Argentina	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							REGION; MIDLATITUDES	This paper deals with the possible occurrence, within the next 100-1000 years, and under the same geomorphological conditions, of meteorological events similar to the precipitation which triggered the hydric erosion that initiated Corralito ravine. The study area is located in the central part of Cordoba Province (32 degrees 05'-31 degrees 45'S; 64 degrees 10'-63 degrees 30'W) in the Plains region. The erosive process was started by the storm of September 1978. Five years later, two extreme rains took place in the same humid period (1983/84), with recurrence intervals of 10 and 25 years, respectively, and in the year 2000 another extreme rainstorm with a 100-year return period occurred. Each event can be correlated with the main reactivation surfaces, visible as successive deepening levels at the gully. Although there is a positive climatic tendency in annual rainfall, due to an increasing number of rainy days, the annual maximum of daily rainfall remained constant. Hence, the dominant factor in the ravine development was the occurrence of convectively generated extreme hydrometeorologic events. Prediction of 24-h maximum rainfall through the DIT Model is applicable to the future, allowing the design of structures required to control overflowing and sediment production.

Since rats are a human commensal, this implies either an earlier visitation by people or problems with the reliability of the AMS determinations. One explanation for the extreme ages is dietary variation involving movement of depleted radiocarbon through dietary food chains to rats. To investigate this, we C-14 dated fauna from the previously well-dated site of Shag River Mouth. The faunal remains were of species that consumed carbon derived from a variety of environments within the-orbit of the site, including the estuary, river, land, and sea. The C-14 results showed a wide range in age among estuarine and freshwater species. Terrestrial and marine organisms produced ages within expectations. We also found differences between bone dated using the Oxford ultrafiltration method and those treated using the filtered gelatin method. This implies that contamination could also be of greater importance than previously thought.

These dynamic surface processes not only influence landscape evolution and river behavior, but severely affect human societies both at present and in the past. Particularly, mass-movement and flooding events caused by earthquakes and/ or typhoons may introduce a huge amount of sediments into river systems, and result in natural hazards due to consequent river-aggradation. The Iron Age Kiwulan Site is a recently discovered archaeological site situated on the margin of the Lanyang Plain in northeastern Taiwan. In its deposits, a cultural hiatus centered on 1150-1350 CE was recognized suggesting that the settlement was abandoned for two hundred years before being recolonized. To find the cause of this cultural break, the river-aggradation history since 800 CE has been reconstructed by a source-to-sink approach using multiple lines of evidence from the Lanyang Source-to-Sink System, northeastern Taiwan. Two particular river-aggradation events that occurred during 875-925 CE and 1400-1500 CE were traced from their source (upland river terrace), through floodplain lakes to their ultimate sink (the Okinawa Trough and Hoping Basin of the Pacific Ocean). However, as these extreme river-aggradation events occurred either significantly earlier or later than the cultural hiatus, dramatic climate and earthquake events are not likely to be the direct causes for the cultural hiatus. Instead, river migration might have been the reason for the abandonment and return of the Kiwulan settlements.

Their importance increases in the regions where other proxies are rare, such as Western Carpathians. Here, we present the first whole-Holocene palaeoclimatic reconstruction for this region based on geochemical proxies. We analysed O-18, C-13 and Mg/Ca ratio on tufa calcite of the Mituchovci site (White Carpathian Mountains, W Slovakia) and compared these with pollen, plant macrofossil and mollusc data. According to O-18, two distinct thermal maxima occurred in the region, around 11.4 ka and between 7.3 and 6.9 ka BP. According to C-13 and Mg/Ca ratio, a steep increase in moisture and rainfall took place around 8.5 ka cal. BP, preceded by a cold and dry event. These events are well reflected in the biotic proxies and are suggested also by other palaeoenvironmental studies from the Carpathians. We found some later fluctuations, with dry and warm Bronze Age (ca. 3.6 ka cal. BP), cold and wet Urnfield period (ca. 2.8 ka cal. BP), warm Roman period (ca. 2 ka cal. BP) and cold but humid Migration period (ca. 1.5 ka cal. BP). We observed extreme abruptness and amplitude of the variation in all geochemical proxies in the last 500 years, when biotic proxies imply a very intense human deforestation. Land-use changes may have altered both the temperature regime in the studied fen and the carbon cycle in the recharge area.

Climate during the Eemian was generally stable but with a distinct west-east gradient in summer. Strong influence of the Atlantic air masses moving to the east resulted in the annual precipitation over 600 mm. Climate instability in the late Eemian as well as during stadials and interstadials of the Early Weichselian was expressed by progressive cooling and increasing temperature difference between winters and summers, reflecting stronger continentalism towards the west, accompanied by decreased precipitation. Periglacial frost crackings and polygonal patterns indicated occurrence of permafrost in Poland already at about 49 ka BP and its occurrence until the termination of the last glaciation. These periglacial structures have developed at mean annual temperatures from -9 to -4 degrees C, with winter extremes up to about -25 degrees C. Mean summer temperature reached likely around 10 degrees C as suggested by palaeobotanic record. Palaeoglaciological studies of mountain glaciers across Europe allowed inferring their activity and sensitivity to climatic fluctuations during the Late Weichselian. The Weichselian of central Europe was controlled mostly by the southerly and easterly circulation dominated by climate cyclones and anticyclones, respectively. An inflow of air masses from the west was significantly limited and concentrated mainly within the so-called periglacial corridor between the Scandinavian ice sheet and the Alps. Such circulation pattern determined serious reduction of precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum that reached 60% in relation to modern conditions. The following Late Pleistocene cold phases (Oldest and Younger Dryas) were slightly warmer and wetter with increasing contribution of the westerlies that were strongly dependent on progressing shrinkage of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.

Three periods of increased flood activity have occurred in Transylvania during the last millennium: the first at the beginning of the 10th century (the end of the Dark Ages Cold Period and beginning of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP)); the second at the end of the 16th and beginning of 17th century, during the cold Little Ice Age (LIA) and the third at the end of the 19th century. During the early MWP, generally wet summers resulted in a high incidence of floods and/or high discharges, while the cluster of floods at the end of 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries occurred mostly at flash floods generated during heavy summer thunderstorms. Increasing winter temperatures and spring precipitations probably caused the high incidence of floods at the end of the 19th century. The predominantly wet conditions during the MWP are likely to have resulted from northward penetration of Mediterranean cyclones during a (mostly) positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), while wet conditions during the LIA arose as a combination of increases in local storminess and moisture transport from the North Atlantic along more southerly positioned westerlies associated with a negative phase of the NAO.

For the Bug loess unit, the equivalent of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 2), results are in agreement between methods, demonstrating that the suite of embryonic soils previously interpreted as reflecting climate variability similar to Greenland interstadials (GI) actually date to similar to 29/27-15 ka, with most emplaced around or after 20 ka. This temporal span is further confirmed by age-depth modelling of available data. Apart from GI-2, no interstadial-type climate events are recorded in Greenland ice core data for that time interval. As short-term pedogenetic phases are also documented in records from central-western Europe, there is a need for more research into the European mid-latitude terrestrial environments response to MIS 2 hydroclimate variability. The dating of Vytachiv paleosol, previously debatably linked to various GI events within MIS 3 resulted in ages of similar to 40 +/- 4 ka and similar to 53 +/- 4 ka at the lower transition, and similar to 26 +/- 2 ka to similar to 30 +/- 2 ka in the overlying loess. These ages indicate that the truncated Vytachiv paleosol is either not continuous, or that it encompasses a broader age range within MIS 3 than previously considered. In both cases, data would not allow for an unambiguous linking of this paleosol with specific GI events as previously attempted. The pIR-IRSL290 dating of the loams immediately underneath Pryluky unit in the range of similar to 120 ka to similar to 168 ka and of the Pryluky mollisol from similar to 90 ka to 126 ka confirm the broad correspondence of this unit with MIS 5, although poor dose recovery results open the possibility for further testing on the degree these ages provide overestimated results. Quartz data severely underestimate the pIR-IRSL290 ages for these samples. The application of pIR-IRSL290 dating for the underlying Dnieper till previously linked to the Saalian glaciation resulted in natural signals at the level of laboratory saturation, yielding minimum ages of c. 700 ka. For the same sample, the natural SAR-OSL signals for 4-11 mu m quartz were found significantly below laboratory saturation level, resulting in finite ages of similar to 250-270 ka interpreted here as underestimates, while coarse quartz (63-90 gm) signals reached about 85% of the laboratory saturation level. These data suggest extreme caution must be taken when dating such old samples using quartz OSL. Results from our high-resolution luminescence dating raises important implications for the chronological representativeness of Stayky as a key loess site in Eastern Europe beyond MIS 2.

Current declines of Pecos River (New Mexico, USA) streamflow in a 700-year context	HOLOCENE			English	Article						dendrochronology; hydrology; New Mexico; reconstruction	TREE-RINGS; RIO-GRANDE; RECONSTRUCTION; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; FLOW	The Pecos River provides an important source of water for New Mexico and Texas, US, and Mexico. Severe and prolonged drought combined with increasing temperatures during the early 21st century boosted attention on water resources and allocation management in the American West. We provide a tree-ring-based streamflow reconstruction for the Pecos River for the period 1310-2013 CE for the overarching purpose of placing the current Pecos River streamflow declines in a multi-century context. Over the past ca. 700 years, dry events (n = 93) that lasted at least 2 years were more common than wet events (n = 76), wherein flow was below/above the instrumental mean (61.6 m(3) s(-1)). Although more prolonged droughts occurred during the 15th and 18th centuries, the gage record (1930-2013 CE) captures the full range and variability of flow extremes within the context of the past 700 years. The 11-year drought of 1772-1782 was the highest ranked based on magnitude + intensity below the instrumental mean, slightly edging out the 1415-1425 and 1950-1957 events. The driest events that have occurred from the 14th through the 20th centuries are challenged by flow conditions since the turn of the 21st century. The 2000-2006 and 2011-2013 dry periods ranked 6th and 13th, respectively, though the intensity (-40 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1)) of the 2011-2013 event exceeded all higher ranked droughts. The lowest single water-year flow in the reconstruction was shared by years 1904 and 2002, during which the flow of the Pecos River was estimated at 8.1 m(3) s(-1). Other extreme low-flow years were 1685 (9.5 m(3) s(-1)) and 1579 (9.8 m(3) s(-1)), but are eclipsed by 1904 and 2002 when considering the lower bounds of bootstrapped confidence limits of the reconstruction. Increased flow variability combined with projected increased temperatures and decreased precipitation will likely present new challenges to water resource managers, especially given impending anthropogenic climate change.

Geoarchaeological evidence of marshland destruction in the area of Rungholt, present-day Wadden Sea around Hallig Sudfall (North Frisia, Germany), by the Grote Mandrenke in 1362 AD	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Harbours from the Roman Period to the Middle Ages	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2015	Kiel, GERMANY			German Wadden Sea; North Frisia; Coastal changes; Medieval storm surges; Rungholt	MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY; GREIGITE FE3S4; LEVEL CURVE; NW GERMANY; WEST-COAST; HOLOCENE; SEDIMENTS; SOIL; GEOCHEMISTRY; SEQUENCE	Geophysical and geoarchaeological investigations were carried out in the Wadden Sea of North Frisia (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) to elucidate major environmental changes that considerably altered the coastal landscape since medieval times. Between the 12th and 14th cent. AD, the present-day tidal flats around the marsh island Hallig Sudfall belonged to the historical Edomsharde district and its main settlement Rungholt. For North Frisia, it is well known that during medieval and early modern times, extreme storm surges caused major land losses associated with a massive landward shift of the coastline. Today, cultural traces like remains of dikes, drainage ditches, terps or even plough marks are still visible in the Wadden Sea and provide evidence of the once cultivated marshland. Based on a multi-proxy analysis of sediment cores retrieved from the tidal flat zone around Hallig Sudfall and from the Hallig itself, we identified a late medieval paleosol associated with the formerly cultivated marshland most probably belonging to the Edomsharde and local trade centre of Rungholt. Around Hallig Sudfall, remains of medieval marsh deposits were found partly eroded and covered by a coarse-grained high-energy deposit including abundant shell debris and artefacts. Based on sedimentological, micropaleontological, geochemical and geochronological data, we conclude that these deposits are associated with the 1st Grote Mandrenke (or St. Marcellus' flood), an extreme storm surge event in 1362 AD. Our results, for the first time, provide geological evidence of this 1362 AD storm surge for the Wadden Sea of North Frisia. Moreover, marshland on Hallig Sudfall dating to the 17th-18th cent. AD was found covered by a thick layer of storm surge sand and shell debris which seems to be associated with one of the major storm event that hit the German North Sea coast in modern times, e.g. the 2nd Grote Mandrenke (or Burchardi flood) in 1634 AD or the Christmas flood in 1717 AD.

Yet, four decades of archaeological research in the atoll archipelago of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia have demonstrated sustained human occupation there for over two millennia. Here, we present a fine-grained analysis of mollusc remains from four recently excavated archaeological sites (4476 total MNI / 14843 total NISP) combined with mapping and analysis of extant benthic habitats, on Ebon Atoll, Marshall Islands. We examine spatial and temporal variability in mollusc foraging practices from prehistoric village sites and ephemeral camp sites across the windward-leeward exposure gradient. Our analysis demonstrates that foragers targeted a rich assemblage of taxa from different habitats, reflecting a foraging strategy that was adapted to local environmental conditions. Human foraging over 2000 years documented no observable human impacts to molluscs or nearshore intertidal marine ecosystems, challenging previous notions of atolls as marginal, exceptionally difficult settings for human habitation. RESUME Les petites iles reculees, comme les atolls coralliens de faible altitude aux sols biogeniques pauvres en elements nutritifs pour les cultures alimentaires et exposes a des conditions climatiques extremes, ont longtemps ete considerees comme des environnements marginaux pour l'habitat humain. Pourtant, quatre decennies de recherches archeologiques dans l'archipel d'atolls des iles Marshall a l'est de la Micronesie y ont demontre une occupation humaine soutenue pendant plus de deux millenaires. Nous presentons ici une analyse nuancee de restes de mollusques provenant de quatre sites recents de fouilles archeologiques (NMI total 4476 / NISP total 14843) combines a une cartographie et une analyse d'habitats benthiques subsistants sur l'atoll d'Ebon dans les iles Marshall. Nous examinons la variabilite spatiale et temporelle dans les pratiques de recherche de nourriture a partir de villages prehistoriques et de sites de campements ephemeres sur un ensemble de pentes exposees au vent et sous le vent. Notre analyse demontre que les chasseurs-cueilleurs visaient une riche association de taxons dans des habitats differents, ceci refletant une strategie de recherche de nourriture adaptee aux conditions ecologiques locales. La recherche de nourriture par l'homme sur 2000 ans n'atteste d'aucun impact de celui-ci observable sur les mollusques ou les ecosystemes marins intertidaux proches du rivage. Ceci met en question des notions anterieures sur les atolls en tant que milieux marginaux, extremement difficiles pour l'habitat humain.

Accordingly, the glacial evolution here might have a different spatial and chronological pattern if compared with other alpine areas. This paper discusses geomorphological evidence of three glacial stages from the Krnica Valley in the Julian Alps of Slovenia, and is the first step towards a comprehensive palaeoglaciological studies in this alpine sector. Very well-preserved glacial landforms in the Upper Krnica Valley allowed the reconstruction of glacier surface topographies and corresponding equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) by means of field-based geomorphological and sedimentological data and by using geospatial analysis. The uppermost frontal moraines belong to the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the corresponding ELA is estimated at 1973 m a.s.l. Other two stages with the ELA depressed by 50 m and 161 m compared to the LIA ELA, suggest early Holocene and Younger Dryas ages of the palaeoglaciers, respectively. This assumption ensues from absolute age datings and related ELA depressions observed elsewhere in the European Alps. The presence of buried ice under the debris in the Krnica cirque, imaged through geophysical investigations, point to peculiar microclimatic conditions able to preserve relict glacier ice. This is favoured by the recursive presence of snow on the ground caused by the extreme summer shading and the significant winter snow-recharge triggered by snowblow and avalanche feeding. The possible evolution of such relict ice under the ongoing climate warming is also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The charred macro-botanical assemblage is dominated by naked barley grains with a few broomcorn and foxtail millet grains. In the context of Trans-Eurasian exchange of cereal crops, southwest Asian crops (wheat and barley) and two Asian millets (broomcorn and foxtail) were introduced to Xinjiang a few centuries to a millennium before Shirenzigou was occupied. The choice of barley cultivation in preference to wheat and millet may have been possibly driven by the relatively extreme local environment and the scheduling requirements of mobile pastoralism. Barley is well suited to this environment, and the choice of naked barley in preference to hulled barley may have been driven by the whole grain tradition prevailing in East Asia.

Remote sensing, detailed field geomorphology, sedimentology, geochemistry and optical chronology suggests that the fluvial sediments fringing the Khadir Island were transported locally and deposited during the extreme hydrological events corresponding to the mid to late-Holocene Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability. Overall five extreme hydrological events are deciphered during the last 5 ka which broadly correlates with periods of strengthened ISM.

Geoarchaeological studies at the cemetery of ancient Kamara, assisted by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating: Insights in the post-Roman hydrological record of Eastern Crete	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Streambed; Alluvial deposits; Medieval Warm Period; OSL dating; Ancient Kamara; Cemetery	MEDITERRANEAN REGION; CLIMATE; HOLOCENE; SINGLE; QUARTZ; SEA; ENVIRONMENT; ATLANTIC; EXTREME; DESIGN	The Late Hellenistic-Roman cemetery of Kamara is considered as one of the largest burial sites of Crete. A large part of the ancient cemetery is currently buried by thick gravelly fluvial sediments, deposited by the activity of the nearby Xeropotamos stream. Specifically, the presence of more than twenty graves in the modern streambed strongly indicates a shift of the stream flow, possibly due to major alluviation events occurred in different periods. With the intention of working out a chronological framework at the Cretan cemetery, this study employed Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Seven OSL ages suggest that Xeropotamos has been active since the 3rd Millennium BC. The streambed migrated to the north-east at the onset of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), before it acquired its present position during the third quarter of the 2nd Millennium AD. The results add new information to the paleoenvironmental record and the earth surface processes that took place in eastern Crete from the Roman period till the end of the Venetian occupancy.

The bloom was discovered on the dolls after 10 years of storage in a climate controlled facility with average temperature at 11-12 degrees C and a relative humidity at 50 +/- 5%. Analysis of the dolls and the bloom was carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that the bloom consisted primarily of stearyl alcohol. Subsequent analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed a minor presence of cetyl alcohol. It is proposed that the alcohol had been added as a lubricant to aid flow during processing. The stearyl alcohol was almost completely reabsorbed into the PVC dolls following one month storage at room temperature, suggesting that low temperature storage played a decisive role in the appearance of the bloom. It is likely that a decrease in temperature has led to a decrease in compatibility of the stearyl alcohol in the PVC compound, thus promoting its exudation. This paper also discusses an extreme bloom of white crystals on other PVC dolls of unknown provenance.

BP) are still very rare in Central Europe, since it is inferred that the extreme climatic conditions caused the decolonisation of previously settled areas. Our study focuses on the reconstruction of environmental conditions in the surroundings of the open-air Palaeolithic site, Brno-Styrice III, which falls within this period. The research concentrated on the study of malacological, pollen and anthracological samples to reconstruct the climate shortly after the LGM. C-14 dating places the chronostratigraphic position of the site more precisely at the end of the LGM, more specifically into Last Glacial Termination (LGT); analysis of chipped stone industry identifies the occupation with the Epigravettian settlement. The site represents a significant example of the recurrent habitation of a microclimatically favourable microregion near a watercourse in order to utilise available sources of livelihood. The results of the pollen, anthracological and malacological analyses documented a more or less treeless character of surrounding landscape. The vegetation was mostly formed by a mixture of shrub tundra and grassy loess steppe vegetation. Open woodland with birch, willow and bird cherry occurred in relatively moist river banks and the lower slopes of hills with more favourable microclimatic conditions. Malacological collection highlights the presence of cool temperate species (Pupilla loessica, Vallonia excentrica and Helicopsis striata). In the surroundings of the studied site, the pollen analysis provided a reconstruction of parkland forest-steppe vegetation (with lack of temperate deciduous trees) typical for a cold and dry climate.

The die-offs occurred in four temporal clusters, as evidenced by nearly coterminous capping horizons across multiple reef heads. These horizons can be correlated to published, calibrated radiocarbon dates ( 2-s uncertainty: +/- similar to 900 years) derived from cored sediments, and placed into the stratigraphic context. The reefs began growing with the initial flooding of the bay at similar to 9600 ybp. The first die-offs are coincident with the transition from upper bay to open bay environment at similar to 8140 ybp, with the greatest concentration of die-offs seaward. Subsequent die-offs occurred similar to 7600, 6870, and 5800 ybp, with a seaward-to-landward progression. These ages appear to either post-date or be concurrent with published periods of accelerated sea level rise of similar to 1-4 m. However, because bay oysters ( Crassostrea virginica) are robust with respect to salinity and depth changes, we cannot directly link die-offs with punctuated sea level rise. We hypothesize instead that reef die-offs are associated with extreme salinity changes caused by droughts, based on observations during the 1950s Texas drought. During that event, bay reefs were colonized by open-ocean species ( Crassostrea equestris), which gradually replaced bay oysters progressing seaward to landward in concentration. Subsequent flooding and rapid freshening of the bay caused massive mortality of the colonizing species. These floods also brought abundant fine-grained sedimentation that could bury reefs before they could be recolonized. Such a sequence of events could explain widespread early Holocene, seaward-to-landward oyster reef die-offs during times of more frequent and severe drought conditions. A plausible climatological link exists between periods of low rainfall in Texas and periods of accelerated melting of the polar ice cap, which could explain the evident correlation between reef die-off and sea level rise.

Climate and trade are crucial for the economy, and these are assumed to be the two main factors in understanding the regional historical development. I present a multi-archive mean annual temperature reconstruction for northeastern Europe spanning the past two millennia, which is used to develop a comparative chronology of climatic and historical events in the study region. It is argued that climate had a profound impact on the Slavic population's economy and directions of migration, facilitating penetration into higher latitudes in warmer and abandonment in colder climatic phases. It is virtually certain that the mode and speed of development and northeastward expansion of the Russian State from the Middle Ages to the Modern Time were in many ways dependent on natural and geographical factors.

Radiocarbon dates and anthropogenic signal in the South-Central Andes (12,500-600 cal. years BP)	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Anthropogenic signal; Archaeological demography; Radiocarbon time-series; Taphonomic bias; South-Central Andes	TEMPORAL FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; EARLY HUMAN OCCUPATION; POPULATION; ARCHAEOLOGY; DEMOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; IMPACT	This paper presents the analysis of the anthropogenic signal documented by four time-series in the highlands of the South-Central Andes (Puna of Argentina and North Chile) spanning the period between 12,500 and 600 cal years BP. Our goal is to extract demographic and occupational histories from temporal data. In this way, based upon the full radiocarbon dataset and the sites of provenance of the dates, we built the following time-series: the summed probability distribution of calibrated ages; the relative frequency of calibrated ages; the relative frequency of sites per unit of time; and the frequency of new sites per unit of time. For controlling the effects of site destruction on the anthropogenic signal, we used the exponential model as well as the volcanic empirical model of taphonomic bias. The four time-series coincide in showing a regional pattern with a phase of low and fluctuating demography of relative long term duration, followed by an growth phase well evident at 5000 cal BP in a context the economic intensification. The long-term demographic success of the hunter-gatherers in the highlands many millennia before the consolidation of food production exemplifies the flexibility of this mode of subsistence for achieving human adaptation to extreme selective environments as the Puna.

This study investigates the statistical relationships between the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the annual and seasonal mean ETo values of 41 weather stations in Iran for 1966-2005. The connections between the AO index and annual ETo are also examined during the extreme phases of the AO (high and low phases). Significant correlations between annual ETo and the corresponding AO index are quite rare, and the differences between the ETo values during the extreme AO phases and the long-term average ETo values were found to be significant only at three out of the 41 study stations. The lag correlations indicated that the greatest positive (0.506) and negative (-0.466) correlation coefficients were found for 2-season time lag. Furthermore, the mean time lag between the start of the AO events and the observed maximum effects on ETo at the study stations was about 1.61 seasons or 5 months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Deer use in good times and in bad: A Fort Ancient case study from southwest Ohio	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Archaeozoology; Drought; Climate Change; White-tailed deer; Fort Ancient; Ohio; USA	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; SUBSISTENCE; STRATEGIES	White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) utilisation before and during increased moisture variability and pronounced drought conditions during the late prehistory of southwestern Ohio is examined to assess the fit with the expectations of foraging efficiency models. The focus is on three Fort Ancient sites in the upper portion of the Great Miami River, including SunWatch, a large village located in present-day Dayton, Ohio. SunWatch was occupied during the Late Prehistoric era in the region. The earlier uses (AD 1150-1300) occurred during optimal moisture conditions. The later uses (AD 1300-1450) occurred within the context of increased droughts and extreme moisture variability. To address questions related to changing deer utilisation in response to drought, deer remains are examined temporally for the SunWatch site and two smaller Fort Ancient sites in the region (Wegerzyn and Wildcat). Results from this preliminary and exploratory study indicate that through time, deer body size is stable or decreases, juvenile deer became more abundant in the hunted assemblages, and human butchering strategies became less selective. These support the conclusion that environmental stress on the deer population led to a change in the deer population and influenced the way humans used deer.

Whereas in the Puna, extreme aridity and high temperatures (the so-called "Hypsithermal" period) have been recorded, a more humid and rainy phase dominated southern Tierra del Fuego. The present paper explores the palaeoenvironmental situation of Isla de los Estados (Staaten Island, 54 degrees 38'-54 degrees 55' S; 63 degrees 48'-64 degrees 46' W) and its relationship with the archaeological record left behind by ancient canoeing people. The considered period is characterized by exceptionally windy conditions. The palaeoenvironmental information could be used as an explanation for the absence of cultural remains and also for the scarce archaeological record for Peninsula Mitre. At the beginning of the Middle Holocene, the diatom record shows a large amount of Aulacoseira sp that could indicate either windy conditions or higher water levels at the site core. The more distinctive changes in the diatom assemblages occurred at ca. 5000 cal BR, suggesting a shallower water level and more acidic conditions. By 3000 cal B.F., the diatom species are strongly linked to peat and swampy environments. However, during the late Holocene, milder conditions might have favored seasonal travelling to the outer islands of the Fuegian Archipelago, though no definitive or permanent settlements have been found.

The earlier Xianyang fauna, that contains Bubalus youngi and Cervus nippon hortulorum, lived in a warm-cool humid environment. The slightly younger Pucheng fauna, yielding desert steppe animals including Equus przewalskyi and Gazella przewalskyi, represented a climate changing from cool humid to dry and cold. The latest Dali fauna, including Mammuthus sp., inhabited a steppe or periglacial environment. Evolutionary changes of species composition in the three faunas reveal the processes of climate and environmental evolution from warm-cool humid to extreme dry and cold conditions during the last glacial maximum.

Because the information currently available on MIS 12 is predominantly derived from marine records, the imprint of this extreme glaciation on the terrestrial realm - and notably on terrestrial ecosystems - has remained poorly constrained. Here we present a new, centennial-scale-resolution pollen record from Lake Ohrid (Balkan Peninsula, SE Europe) augmented by pollen-based quantitative temperature and precipitation estimates. Our dataset, which spans the period from 488 to 420 ka, shows that the forest cover around Lake Ohrid decreased substantially over the course of MIS 12; this decrease was associated with a gradual lowering of winter and mean annual temperatures (and to a lesser extent of summer temperatures) as well as mean annual precipitation. Superimposed on this long-term development, abrupt changes in regional forest cover indicate a pronounced millennial-scale climate variability that bears strong resemblance to the interstadial and stadial events of the Last Glacial. This variability is expressed by repeated high-amplitude forest expansions and contractions around Lake Ohrid during MIS 12c and the oldest part of 12b substage (i.e., from similar to 477 to similar to 448 ka). The forest oscillations can be correlated to previously documented episodes of surface-water variability and ice-rafted debris deposition in the North Atlantic. This pattern suggests a coupling between the climatically forced treepopulation changes in SE Europe and the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation during MIS 12c and partially 12b on millennial timescales. In contrast, the youngest part of MIS 12b and MIS 12a (i.e., from similar to 448 to 424 ka) lack high-amplitude forest expansions and contractions around Lake Ohrid. Comparison with sea-level reconstructions for MIS 12 suggests that millennial-scale vegetation variability in Lake Ohrid was strongest when sea level was between 30 and 100 m lower than today, whereas it was absent when sea level was lower than 100 m relative to the present.

In all, 12 radiocarbon dates show that Avery Lake formed at 1130 BCE (3100 cal. yr BP), almost 3000 years later than previously thought, indicating that the Black Bottom floodplain is younger and more dynamic than previously estimated. Three subsequent periods of extensive land clearance were identified by changes in pollen composition, corresponding to Native American occupations before 1500 CE and the current Euro-American occupation beginning in the 18th century. Sedimentation rates prior to 1820 CE changed independently of land clearance events, suggesting natural as opposed to land-use controls. Comparison with high-resolution paleoclimate data from Martin Lake, IN, indicates that lower Ohio River flooding was frequent when cold-season precipitation originating from the Pacific/Arctic predominated when atmospheric circulation resembled positive Pacific North American (PNA) conditions and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a positive mean state (1130 BCE to 350 CE and 1150-1820 CE). Conversely, Ohio River flooding was less frequent when warm-season precipitation from the Gulf of Mexico prevailed during negative PDO- and PNA-like mean states (350 and 1150 CE). This flood dynamic appears to have been fundamentally altered after 1820 CE. We suggest that extensive land clearance in the Ohio River watershed increased runoff and landscape erosion by reducing interception, infiltration, and evapotranspiration, thereby increasing flooding despite a shift to negative PDO- and PNA-like mean states. Predicted increases in average precipitation and extreme rainfall events across the mid-continental US are likely to perpetuate current trends toward more frequent flood events, because anthropogenic modifications have made the landscape less resilient to changing hydroclimatic conditions.

Thus, when we began our human ecodynamics research project focused on the fauna from Cix(w)ic(sic)n (45CA523, pronounced ch-WHEET-son), a large ancestral village of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, located on the shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Angeles, Washington (USA), we anticipated generally high levels of bone identifiability. We quickly realized that the mammal bones were more fragmented and less identifiable than we had expected, though this was not the case with the bird and fish bone or invertebrate remains. To better understand why this fragmentation occurred at Cix(w)ic(sic)n, we evaluate numerous hypotheses, including both post-depositional and behavioral explanations. We conclude that multiple factors intersected (to varying degrees) to produce the extreme bone fragmentation and low identifiability of mammal bones at the site, including bone fuel use, marrow extraction, grease rendering, tool production, and post-depositional breakdown. Using a human ecodynamics framework, we further consider how both social factors and external environmental forces may mediate human choices, such as the economic decision to use bone for fuel or render bone grease. We place our findings from Cix(w)ic(sic)n in a regional context and discuss the potential of the approach for other coastal archaeological sites worldwide.

Here, we report paleolimnological and archeological data from Lake Suches in southern Peru (70 degrees 24' 12 W, 16 degrees 55' 35 S) spanning 13.6-4.4 kyr BP. Integrated paleoclimate and archeological data reveal that moisture was locally available and the basin served as an ecological refugium throughout the mid-Holocene. Mid-Holocene aridity was established no later than 7.2 kyr BP, with maximum aridity ca. 5.5-4.8 kyr BP. However, water levels in Lake Suches were sustained throughout peak middle-Holocene aridity, even as other systems desiccated. Isotopic enrichment of water in Lake Suches (O-18(lake)) and extensive wetlands (O-18(bofedal)) surrounding the lake indicate prolonged residence time. These reservoirs, combined with elevation-linked hydrographic factors, mitigated mid-Holocene net decreases in atmospheric moisture. Archeological data from Suches indicate successive population increases beginning ca. 11.0-9.8 kyr BP as drier but more stable early Holocene conditions were established regionally. Population maxima in Suches during the mid-Holocene/mid-Archaic period ca. 9.0-7.0 kyr BP coincide with peak aridity in the Titicaca and Atacama systems, as well as documented archeological hiatuses in these regions. Population decreases coincide with peak aridity recorded in Lake Suches ca. 6.0-5.0 kyr BP, but the basin was never fully abandoned. Evidence for refugial microenvironments is key to understanding the persistence of human populations and other endemic Andean flora and fauna during the highly adverse climates of the middle-Holocene. We outline several mechanisms which likely explain the formation of refugia linked to bofedales and hydrographic characteristics of Suches. Understanding refugial dynamics will be key to understanding the effects of past climatic change, as well as addressing current warming and decreased precipitation trends in the tropical Andes.

It is part of a limestone cave system facing the adjacent Governor's Beach on the south-eastern coast of Gibraltar and has been filled to the roof with more than 17 m of sedimentary deposits. Due to its long stratified sequence, comprising rich palaeoenvironmental and faunal records as well as multiple Palaeolithic occupation layers, Vanguard Cave provides valuable information for our understanding of human behaviour and dispersal across south-eastern Iberia in general and particularly about the strategic role of the promontory of Gibraltar for past human populations. The development of a reliable absolute chronology for the sedimentary sequence at Vanguard Cave is therefore of great importance in this context. In this study, we applied optically-stimulated luminescence dating to sand-sized quartz grains from the uppermost similar to 4 m of the Vanguard Cave deposits, as well as from the Hyaena Cave sediments - a small niche adjacent to the main cave chamber. We use single-grain and multiple-grain dating to clarify the depositional history of the sedimentary sequence, as well as to assess the reliability of the two dating approaches and their potential for future chronological studies at the site. The single-grain and multi-grain ages are consistent with one another and indicate no partial bleaching or post-depositional mixing of the sediments. Our results suggest that Vanguard Cave experienced continuous sediment accumulation probably since the last sea-level highstand in MIS 5, and was completely filled by similar to 43 ka (MIS 3). The eastern side of the Rock of Gibraltar faced an exposed coastal shelf covered with savannah and an active coastal dune system during MIS 3. Our results indicate that similar environmental conditions are likely to have persisted also during MIS 4 and large parts of MIS 5. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

From close to the key hominin site of Omo-Kibish, we provide near continuous proxy evidence for environmental changes in lake sediment cores from the Chew Bahir basin, south Ethiopia. The data show highly variable hydroclimate conditions from 116 to 66 kyr BP with rapid shifts from very wet to extreme aridity. The wet phases coincide with the timing of the North African Humid Periods during MISS, as defined by Nile discharge records from the eastern Mediterranean. The subsequent record at Chew Bahir suggests stable regional hydrological setting between 58 and 32 kyr (MIS4 and 3), which facilitated the development of more habitable ecosystems, albeit in generally dry climatic conditions. This shift, from more to less variable hydroclimate, may help account for the timing of later dispersal events of AMH out of Africa. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The study of the two karst lakes where sediment composition is mainly calcite, showed that organic matter (OM) also plays an important role, and that both fractions analysed simultaneously give a good overview of the processes in the lakes. The morphological and structural properties of the calcite particles at micron and submicron levels indicate that the calcite mineral phase is formed by active authigenic precipitation in the studied lake systems. In the small Lake KaluCerovac, the measured distributions of carbonate and OM fractions, C/N, TOC, and a(14)C and delta C-13 values of both fractions along the sediment depth showed similar values for all three cores, with small variations in each core indicating very homogenous precipitation of autochthonous calcite inside the lake, without allochthonous fraction. In the bigger Lake Prosce, the large difference in sediment composition of the three cores indicated different conditions of sediment precipitation inside the lake. Significant fractions of land-derived carbonate and OM were recognized by mineralogical, C/N, a(14)C and delta C-13 values in the shallow, coastal area indicating that the sediment was a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous fractions. In contrast, the composition of the deep-water sediment in the same lake indicated in-situ calcite precipitation and aquatic OM produced in the lake. Sedimentation rates of 0.7 cm/yr and from 0.3 to 0.7 cm/yr for Lake Prosce and Lake KaluCerovac, respectively, were determined based on the a(14)C of macrofossils. Extreme hydrological events in 1981 and 2010 were identified by disturbances in carbon isotopes distributions in sediment profiles. No evidence of anthropogenic influence in either lake on the local level was found, but the response to the global C-14 contamination was observed by a14C peaks in both, carbonate and organic fractions. Increased bioproductivity in the recent decades was observed in Lake Prosce which can be correlated with a slight increase in lake water temperature in the last three decades. This process can be associated with enhanced eutrophication in Lake Prosce. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Two fossil assemblages, exceptionally rich in plant remains, allowed for a detailed description of the palaeo-vegetation during two climate extremes of the Late Pleistocene, the onset of the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the last interglacial. In addition, altogether 41 assemblages were used to outline the vegetation history since the penultimate cold stage of MIS 6. Accordingly, meadow steppes analogue to modern communities of the phytosociological order Festucetalia lenensis formed the primary vegetation during the Saalian and Weichselian cold stages. Cold-resistant tundra-steppe communities (Carici rupestris-Kobresietea bellardii) as they occur above the treeline today were, in contrast to more northern locations, mostly lacking. During the last interglacial, open coniferous woodland similar to modern larch taiga was the primary vegetation at the site. Abundant charcoal indicates wildfire events during the last interglacial. Zoogenic disturbances of the local vegetation were indicated by the presence of ruderal plants, especially by abundant Urtica dioica, suggesting that the area was an interglacial refugium for large herbivores. Meadow steppes, which formed the primary vegetation during cold stages and provided potentially suitable pastures for herbivores, were a significant constituent of the plant cover in the Yana Highlands also under the full warm stage conditions of the last interglacial. Consequently, meadow steppes occurred in the Yana Highlands during the entire investigated timespan from MIS 6 to MIS 2 documenting a remarkable environmental stability. Thus, the proportion of meadow steppe vegetation merely shifted in response to the respectively prevailing climatic conditions. Their persistence indicates low precipitation and a relatively warm growing season throughout and beyond the late Pleistocene. The studied fossil record also proves that modern steppe occurrences in the Yana Highlands did not establish as late as in the Holocene but instead are relicts of a formerly continuous steppe belt extending from Central Siberia to Northeast Yakutia during the Pleistocene. The persistence of plants and invertebrates characteristic of meadow steppe vegetation in interior Yakutia throughout the late Quaternary indicates climatic continuity and documents the suitability of this region as a refugium also for other organisms of the Pleistocene mammoth steppe including the iconic large herbivores.

Parasite eggs are usually highly degraded in ancient sites dated from all periods of time and taphonomic factors are mentioned to explain absence and low quantity of eggs found. In this study, we compare parasite egg recovery of three Great House latrines: two from Aztec Ruins (Rooms 219 and 225) and one from Salmon Ruins. We compared through statistical regression the recovery of eggs with the abundance of two classes of decomposers: mites and nematodes. These microorganisms have relation with nematode larvae and parasites remains degradation, respectively, mostly in moist environments. Pinworm was the only parasite found in the sites studied. Prevalences were 32.8% at Salmon Ruins, 72.7% at Aztec Ruins Room 225 and 14.3% at Room 219. Egg preservation was considered good at Salmon Ruins and Aztec Ruins Room 225. M Room 219, the eggs were badly preserved and there was a significant statistical correlation with mites (multiple r (18) = 0.64/P = 0.002). This correlation could indicate that mites could be involved in preservation, and consequently that pinworm prevalence in this latrine is underestimated. Abiotic factors such as humidity could have possibly favored the biological relation. Considering the extreme egg degradation at Room 219, it is not possible to strictly compare parasite data with other Ancestral Pueblo sites, even with Room 225, located at the same site. Room 225 prevalence is the highest found in Ancestral Pueblo sites until now. Taphonomic analysis shows that decomposers operated at different levels of severity, despite the latrines' close location.

Long-term aeolian deflation by prevailing onshore winds has resulted in the deposition of sand on the irregular surface of a Miocene-aged anhydrite outcrop. Two deposits similar to 25 km apart, along the prevailing wind trajectory, were hand excavated then analyzed for vertical (and temporal) changes in physical and chemical composition. Radiocarbon ages of organic matter embedded within the deposits show that rapid accumulation of sediment began at the last glacial maximum and slowed considerably after the Pacific Ocean attained its present post-glacial level. Over this time period, grain sizes are seen to increase while accumulation rates simultaneously decrease, suggesting greater wind speeds and/or a change or decrease in sediment supply. Changes in delta S-34 values of sulfate in the sediment beginning similar to 10 ka indicate an increase in marine sources. Similarly, delta H-2 values from palmitic acid show a steady increase at similar to 10 ka, likely resulting from aridification of the region during the Holocene. Due to the extreme aridity in the region, these sand dunes retain a well-preserved chemical record that reflects changes in elevation and coastal proximity after the last glacial maximum.

The series is based on six types of proxies extracted from historical documents, including the southern limits of frost disaster, freezing disaster and snow, along with snowfall days and the first/last frost disaster dates. In the reconstruction, linear regression models are established among each proxy and regional winter temperature. Variance matching, minimum selection, and envelope analysis methods are performed to eliminate non -homogeneous effects because of different proxy types, missing data, and the changing amount of records. Compared with the average temperatures during 1851-1950, the reconstruction shows that southern China experienced a cold period in the first 40 years of the sixteenth century with an average of -0.40 degrees C with frequent extremes. An upturning occurred during the 1540s to mid-1560s, followed by a stable phase until the 1620s. Then the temperature started to fall from the 1630s and reached its lowest in 1660, where it dropped to -2.01 degrees C. Moreover, the mean value was 0.49 degrees C between the years 1648-1697, which was the coldest 50 years over the last five centuries. The temperatures during the eighteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century was characterized by annual to decadal fluctuations, with two moderately warm intervals in the 1770s and 1840s -1850s, as well as three moderately cold intervals in 1790s, 1830s, and 1870s to the mid-1890s. Over the recent century, the warming rate since 1901 was 0.56 degrees C/100a, whereas the temperature reached 0.32 degrees C/10a after 1979. The hottest five years during the last five centuries all occurred after 1990. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In both these southern mid-latitude regions, evidence for extensive and repeated glaciations during cold phases of the Quaternary is manifested by arrays of successively older glacial drift deposits with corresponding outwash plain remnants. In South Westland, these variably aged glacial landforms are mantled by layered (multisequal) soils characterised by slow loess accretion and pedogenesis in an extreme leaching and weathering environment. These cover-bed successions have undergone repeated coupled phases of topdown and up building soil formation that have been related to fluctuating cycles of interglacial/warm and glacial/cold climate during the Quaternary. In this study, we recognise multisequal soils overlying glacial landforms in southern continental Chile but, unlike the spodic (podzolic) soil sequences of South Westland, these are of dominantly volcanigenic (andic) provenance and are very similar to multisequal soils of andic provenance that predominate in, and adjacent to, areas of rhyolitic to andesitic volcanism in North Island, New Zealand. Here we develop a soil-stratigraphic model to explain the observed occurrence of multisequal soils mantling dominantly glacial landforms of southern continental Chile. Based on proxy data from southern Chile, we propose that persistent vegetation cover and high precipitation on the western side of the Andes, during colder-than-present episodes tended to suppress the widespread production of glacially-derived loessial materials despite the pervasive occurrence of glacial and glacio-fluvial deposits that have frequently inundated large tracts of this landscape during the Quaternary. Given the lack of loess cover-beds that have traditionally assisted in the relative dating of glacial episodes prior to the Late Quaternary, surface exposure dating techniques could provide another chronological alternative to address this issue. However, there have been two main obstacles to successfully apply this dating technique in Patagonia. First, minimum exposure ages may be obtained on moraines older than the last glacial cycle due to erosion, although dating outwash plains is more robust. Second, on the wet western side adjacent to the Andes, persistent vegetation cover during both glacial and post-glacial times, as well as widespread inundation by volcanic mass-flows, appear preventive. We make a case that soil genesis within this region appears to be dominated by a constant flux of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra which has continued to upbuild soils at the ground surface separated by intervals where topdown weathering processes are intensified. As already demonstrated by New Zealand studies, multisequal soil successions have a clear implied connection to coupled glacial and interglacial climate cycles of the Quaternary. On this basis, similar sequences in northwest Patagonia provide a relatively untapped archive to enable Quaternary glacial and environmental changes in this pervasively glaciated volcanic region to be constructed.

Significantly positive correlation was found between tree-ring index and the mean minimum temperature from May to July, i.e. 28 to 42 pentads (r = 0.625, p < 0.001). Based on this relationship, the May to July mean minimum temperature was reconstructed in the last 194 years, with an explained variance of 39.1% for the calibration period from 1957 to 2007. The results of leave-one-out tests showed that the reconstruction mode was stable and reliable. This minimum temperature reconstruction revealed that cold spans mainly occurred in 1816-1831, 1840-1852, 1879-1888 and 1976-1984, while warm spans prevailed in 1863-1878, 1889-1897, 1916-1932 and 2000-2007. Comparisons with other surrounding temperature series from tree rings, our reconstruction could provide a good regional representation of temperature change in the mid-Qinling Mountains. The reconstructed minimum temperature series was further verified by dryness-wetness index (DWI) sequence based on Chinese historical literature. Significant quasi-periodic signals at 32.2a, 20.5a, 8.9-13.1a and 2-8a suggested that temperature variability in the study area may associate with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Extreme hydrological events destabilize aquatic ecosystems and open doors for alien species	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Sino-German Symposium on Lake-Catchment Interactions and their Responses to Hydrological Extremes	OCT, 2015	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA			Aquatic ecosystems; Alien species; Extreme climatic events; Ecosystem alternative states	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CURRENT INVASIONS; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; PLANT INVASIONS; LAKE; REGIME; STATES; CHINA; PRECIPITATION; BIODIVERSITY	The number of alien species invasions steadily grows worldwide, as well as the frequency of extreme climatic/hydrological events (ECEs/EHEs). ECEs and the invasion of alien species are among the main reasons for catastrophic transformations of aquatic ecosystems, watersheds, and human activities worldwide. Along with other negative results ECE may facilitate biological invasions. The objective of this review paper is to summarize how extreme climatic events may improve the likelihood of successful invasions in aquatic ecosystems and analyze some of the mechanisms. The morphometric characteristics of water bodies and their positions in the landscape connectivity may influence lake processes. ECE may result in an extreme ecological response - destabilization of an ecosystem and abrupt shift towards an alternative new state. Lakes' peculiarities mediate the effect of ECE influences on a lake ecosystem and determine whether the ecosystem response will be catastrophic or not. Different ecosystem alternative stable states have different levels of ecosystem immunity to invasions. ECEs can destabilize ecosystems and push them towards a tipping point where an ecosystem is most vulnerable. In a destabilized ecosystem near tipping point, ecosystem immunity is sharply decreased and the 'door' for alien species opens. The invasion process has several steps, and ECEs influence all of them. We are beginning to understand the association of ECE with invasions; to gain a deeper understanding of this we should integrate and coordinate the joint efforts of climatologists, hydrologists, limnologists, ecologists and biologists in this direction.

Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ecology of Holocene camelids in the Southern Puna (Antofagasta de la Sierra, Catamarca, Argentina): Archaeological and environmental implications	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Camelids; Carbon stable isotopes; Nitrogen stable isotopes; Holocene; Puna	STABLE-ISOTOPES; DIET	This article focuses on camelid isotope ecology from archaeological sites dating to the Holocene (c. 9800-420 BP) located in the Southern Argentine Puna. We present 92 carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) extracted from wild (Vicugna vicugna and Lama guanicoe) and domesticated (L. glama) camelid bone collagen. The samples come from the following archaeological sites: Quebrada Seca 3, Cueva Salamanca 1, Penas de la Cruz 1.1, Casa Chavez Monticulos 1 and 4, Bajo del Coypar II, Cueva Cacao 1A, Real Grande 1, and Real Grande 6, all of them located over 3300 masl in Antofagasta de la Sierra, Catamarca, Argentina. Mean carbon isotopic relationship (delta C-13) was -17.2, ranging from -20.1 to -11.6, and mean nitrogen isotopic relationship (delta N-15) was 6.8, ranging from 3.4 to 10.8. We interpret these isotope values against the background of environmental and cultural changes that occurred throughout this period. Variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were generally not structured per the availability of different pasture areas across varying altitude. Instead, there was an appreciable increase of some delta C-13 values in domesticated camelids, suggesting the use of complementary forage in their diet. That aside, the isotope values do not differ significantly among the different camelid taxa. More generally, a noticeable increase in delta N-15 values, and to a lesser extent in delta C-13 values, was noted at around 8000 BP, coinciding with a palaeoclimatic phase of extreme regional aridity. Yet, no significant increase of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values was recorded during a later arid phase (1500 BP), and no significant variations were observed in isotope values during the arid and wet fluctuations (sub-phases) within each of the principal Holocene palaeoenvironmental phases recorded for the region. These results highlight the varying magnitude of past climatic changes and their differential impact, and emphasise the need to investigate further into the environmental aspects that produce variation in isotope data.

Impact of modern cattle feeding practices onmilk fatty acid stable carbon isotope compositions emphasise the need for caution in selecting reference animal tissues and products for archaeological investigations	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Modern reference materials; Animal fats; Lipid residue analyses; Dairy fats; Silage	CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ORGANIC RESIDUES; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; MILK-FAT; POTTERY; ORIGIN; DIET; COWS	Degraded animal fats, characterised by the presence of palmitic (C-16: 0) and stearic (C-18: 0) fatty acids and related glycerolipids are the most common class of preserved lipids in organic residues trapped in the porous clay matrix of archaeological ceramic vessels. The ubiquitous presence of fatty acids in animal fats and plant oils precludes identification of fat types by the solely molecular composition of residues. Hence, animal fats are identified by determining their fatty acyl lipid distributions and stable carbon (delta C-13) values allowing distinctions to be drawn between non-ruminant and ruminant, and dairy and adipose fats. The Delta C-13 proxy (= delta C-13(18: 0) - delta C-13(16: 0)) originally proposed in the 1990s by Evershed and co-workers was based on modern reference fats sampled from animals raised in Britain on C3 plant diets. Further analyses on adipose and dairy fats from ruminants grazing in a wide range of isoscapes have shown that the Delta C-13 proxy can be applied in mixed C-3/C-4 environments, such as in Africa. Here we show, however, through the investigation of milk fats, how the Delta C-13 proxy can be perturbed when animals are reared on modern diets, specifically maize silage. It is thus shown that extreme care has to be taken when choosing modern reference fats for archaeological studies, and especially that insecurely sourced animal fats should be excluded from such databases.

Seasonal radiocarbon reservoir ages for the 17th century James River, Virginia estuary	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY			English	Article						Radiocarbon; Reservoir age (Delta R); Sclerochronology; Crassostrea virginica; Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); Estuary	METABOLIC CARBON CONTRIBUTION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; ORGANIC-MATTER; DELTA-R; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; AMERICAN OYSTER; MARINE SAMPLES; UNITED-STATES; C-14	This study utilizes a combined stable isotope and C-14 dating approach to determine the radiocarbon reservoir age correction, Delta R, for the James River, Virginia estuary from 17th century Crassostrea virginica shells of known collection dates. Delta R, which can vary spatially and temporally, is a locality-specific adjustment applied to the global ocean reservoir, R, to further account for the offset between the atmospheric and marine C-14 calibration curves. To assess the temporal variability in Delta R, continuous delta O-18 sampling along the oyster shell hinge provides a seasonal record throughout the oyster's life. This is then used to identify sampling locations for C-14 measurements based on calcite precipitated during the Summer (> 19 degrees C) and Fall through Spring (F-Sp, < 15 degrees C) months. The resulting seasonal Delta R values range from -151 +/- 46 to +109 +/- 55 C-14 years (260 years) due to changes in the contribution and age of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from marine and freshwater sources in the James River estuary. The F-Sp samples display a larger Delta R range than the Summer samples, as do the shells precipitated during drought conditions (1606-1612) when compared to shells from the remainder of the 17th century. The largest intrashell Delta R variability, 195 C-14 years, is similarly found in a drought shell and is attributed to variability caused by the extreme regional 1606-1612 drought. Early land use changes related to European development and farming practices also altered the age of DIC in the James River estuary. We estimate that the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contributing to freshwater DIC ranged from 0 to similar to 1800 years old and reflected both the drought and land use changes that occurred during the 17th century. Using only the Summer samples, which represent the majority of shell calcite, we obtain a mean Delta R = -32 +/- 11 C-14 years (1 sigma) for 17th century James River estuary Delta R at the very onset of European colonization. Employing a seasonally resolved sampling method will provide the greatest constraint on C-14 measurements in an estuarine environment where multiple carbon sources can fluctuate on seasonal timescales and as a result of large scale environmental change.

Here, we provide an overview of the postglacial ecosystem and vegetation dynamics on both slopes of the Fuegian Andes by combining palynological records of pollen and fungal remains analyses, supported by radiocarbon datings and multivariate statistics. The pollen data from the two sites indicate initial shrubby and herbaceous vegetation with scattered trees, under drier and colder climate conditions than today. Expansion of Nothofagus forest began about 11,200 cal BP in the Terra Australis area, while an open vegetation of grasslands and shrubs developed around La Correntina site by 11,500 cal BP followed by the establishment of the forest-steppe ecotone after 9400 cal BP. These vegetation changes implied a modification of the climate toward warmer and drier climate conditions than present. At both sites, the predominance of the mycorrhizal Glomus was related to the presence of open ground grassland, indicating relatively dry local conditions. Closed -canopy forests dominated the landscape after 6500 cal BP at Terra Australis, and after 5000 cal BP at La Correntina, suggesting relatively cold and wet environmental conditions. However, the fungal assemblage in Terra Australis shows high abundances of epiphyllous Microthyriaceae, pointing that the Nothofagus trees grew closer than at La Correntina. These findings allow us to conclude that both mires have experienced dissimilar trends in the environmental evolution since Late-glacial times, probably due to their locations in two distinct flanks of the Andean range.

However, long-term historical records, which reveal the impacts of ENSO variability on climatic and environmental changes in this region, are scarce. A sediment core (G9) was collected from the estuarine delta of the Changjiang River. And its elemental ratios, mineral compositions, and grain size distribution were analyzed to investigate the links between sediment parameters in this region and the history of ENSO variability during the last century. Observed variations in K2O/Na2O, Al2O3/SiO2, and Rb/Sr ratios are synchronous with changes in mineral compositions and grain size throughout the sediment core. Lower K2O/Na2O, Al2O3/SiO2, and Rb/ Sr ratios generally correspond to lower ratios of clay minerals to rock-forming minerals and larger grain sizes, which in turn correspond to periods of flooding in the Changjiang River basin. Such trends probably reflect increased physical erosion and the transport of greater amounts of coarse-grained suspended matter to the estuary. These geochemical proxies are also positively correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies in the Nino-3.4 region (120 degrees W -170 degrees W, 5 degrees S -5 degrees N) (using a low-pass filter with a cut-off of 13 years). We therefore conclude that (1) ENSO-related flood events in the Changjiang River basin have a strong influence on physical erosion processes in the upper catchment area and thereby influence the grain size distribution, elemental ratios, and mineral compositions of the estuarine sediments; and (2) the geochemical records presented here can serve as a proxy for ENSO-driven regional weathering variations on decadal to centennial time scales, because they could potentially be recorded in longer sediment cores recovered from the Changjiang River estuary.

In this study, we present numerous physical and biological indices for a 4000-year core from the Honghe National Natural Reserve (HE), a dish-like depression peatland in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The history of vegetation change was reconstructed by combining plant macrofossils and pollen data from the core, and the water level changes were reconstructed through a multi-proxy study of plant macrofossils, charcoal, stable carbon isotopes, testate amoebae, sediment grain size, loss on ignition, humification degree and magnetic susceptibility. We found that the HE peatland featured wet condition from 4000 to 3600 cal yr BP, which was in accordance with the extreme flooding event at 4.0 lea in northern China. Significant drier shifts were recorded at 3600 and 1200 cal yr BP, while significant wetter shifts were recorded at 2600 and 500 cal yr BP. Factor analysis were applied to all of the proxies to reduce the seven variables to two factors, and the biological indicators, such as plant macrofossils, charcoal and stable carbon isotopes, were found to be more sensitive than the other parameters to water level changes over the last 4000 years. Furthermore, the multi-proxy reconstruction of the wetness of the HE peatland resembles the pattern observed at other sites in Northeast China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The forces of decay and erasure experienced by migrants and the things they carry ensure the rapid disappearances of the tracesprimary material evidenceof this already invisible and precarious social movement as it unfolds. Playing a large role in this erasure is U.S. border security policy, which routes migrants into remote spaces where their experiences are hidden and where they are likely to become lost, to become hurt, and die. The environment of Arizona's Sonoran Desert rapidly decays both objects and human bodies when people die en route, where migrant death is as high per capita as it has ever been. When discovered by land managers, investigators, or others, the things migrants leave behind and their bodies after death are actively removed from the landscape. Remarkable within this context of erasure are the semi-permanent and deliberately placed vernacular shrines, which mark migrants' engagement with risk. The evocative nature of shrines inspires their preservation and curation by non-migrants who encounter them. As shrine sites directly engage with the risks migrants face, because of their sacred aura, and because they uniquely persevere in the harsh desert landscape, these sites serve as memento mori. Tethered in place, they become physical and emotional points of reference for navigating a landscape characterized by risk and uncertainty.

We considered 20 weather stations and three types of topography: summit, slope and depression. We used a change-point regression model with serially correlated errors and compared it with a mainstream literature change-point model with independent errors. For both models, we identified decreasing trends before the change-point and increasing trends afterwards for most summer temperature series. The model with serially correlated errors gives change-points and trends that are more variable for lower altitude and more similar with each other at higher altitudes. One of the possible factors explaining this behavior is that temperatures from some weather stations in depression areas may be influenced by human settlings and industrial activities, and this influence would dissipate with altitude. On the other hand, the model with independent errors shows no pattern in the variability of change points or trends. The cluster analysis also reveals that weather stations are best grouped by altitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Overall, the BRR record shows independent responses of vegetation and fire regime to climate variation. The reconstructions suggest strong seasonal bias from the proxies evaluated, with the pollen record most sensitive to insolation-driven summer temperature trends, and the charcoal-based fire record more sensitive to winter snowpack variability. Together, the proxies suggest that the early Holocene experienced larger than average snowpacks but very warm summers. Warmer than modern summer temperatures were maintained through much of the mid-Holocene, but snowpacks decreased dramatically, creating the most extreme xeric conditions in the Holocene between similar to 7100 and 6000 BP. After 6000 BP, summers began to show a consistent cooling trend. Winter precipitation remained low until similar to 4400 BP, after which higher than average snowpacks are indicated until 2000 BP. Pollen and charcoal data relationships at similar to 8800 BP and from 1800 to 800 BP suggest periods with anomalously wet summers that created a unique fire regime during those intervals.

Who informs the public about their 'national' past? The case of Romania	ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIALOGUES			English	Article						Dacians; Late Iron Age; nationalism; pseudoarchaeology; re-enactment; Romania		This paper addresses the role of archaeologists in informing the public about a fundamental component of contemporary Romanian identity: the Dacian heritage. I start by exploring how the Dacians and Romanians came to be connected, a process that resulted from a combination of nationalistic zeal on behalf of archaeologists and the nationalist propaganda of the Ceau, sescu regime during the 1970s and 1980s. I then move to the present-day situation, where I argue that archaeologists have reduced themselves to having a minor role in the public sphere, while discussions about the Dacians are dominated by two main players: pseudoarchaeologists and re-enactors. This state of affairs delegitimizes Romanian archaeology and places self-declared specialists and enthusiasts in the position of experts. Some of the Dacian narratives produced in this environment are infused with strong nationalist messages and have the potential to fuel extreme right-wing and even xenophobic movements. Consequently, in the final part of the paper, I recommend that Romanian archaeologists should challenge the representations and interpretations of pseudoarchaeologists and re-enactors. Moreover, academics should make it a priority to re-engage with the public and disseminate their work to a broad audience in a convincing manner.

We present an exploratory case-study that attempts to reconcile the chemical fingerprints of major volcanism in Greenland ice-cores for the years 670-730 CE. This period experienced considerable volcanic perturbation with multiple volcanic signals registered in all 8 Greenland ice-core datasets studied, including some comparable in magnitude to the great 1815 Tambora eruption, but reconciling signals with divergent dating between datasets presents a number of challenges. To further our understanding of the volcanic history of this period, frost-rings, tree-ring growth width and density minima from Europe, Siberia and China are considered together with Western European, Near Eastern and Chinese documentary evidence. These reveal a striking sequence of co-occurring inter-regional climatic extremes and social crises. We further examine a recently proposed 7-year adjustment to the GICC05 chronology used by many Greenland ice cores, and find that this results in a more coherent volcanic history for these years, and an improved agreement with tree-ring and written records. Three major volcanic events can now be identified, dated to 681, 684 -686 and 706-707, with several moderate events further contributing to a sustained climate perturbation reflected in prolonged temperature reductions in high-resolution reconstructions.

Today's world is in many ways globalized. Human actions have an impact at local as well as global level. Information travels fast, more or less in real time. To set up a framework for international interactions and cooperation, the majority of the recognized nations have joined the United Nations and signed the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Global societal priorities are various and wide-ranging. This paper deals primarily with those that are referred to under the UN Millennium Development Goals and the term Sustainable Development. The first aims to fight extreme poverty, raise education levels, achieve gender equality, combat diseases, etc. The second deals with the interconnecting systems of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. A core aspect in the discussion is that culture and cultural heritage is integrated in all human activities, yet is diverse because culture holds various values, meanings, and functions for different groups in society. Cultural heritage is a powerful tool to reach and interact with people. It can be used for good and for ill. For conservation science as a discipline to take its professional responsibility seriously, it should contribute to the multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary environment of conservation, and enhance its benefits for society. Through advanced research it can provide historical perspectives and raise awareness of traditional methods, transforming it into 'easily accessible' knowledge. It can also contribute by providing facts and information that can open up different narratives based on the same cultural historical realia. Examples of how that can be done are given under the headings: social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Finally, addressing the global conservation community, the following three areas are recommended for future development: the need for process managers and facilitators; the need for active participation in the global sustainability challenges, and the need for inspirational role models and case studies.
